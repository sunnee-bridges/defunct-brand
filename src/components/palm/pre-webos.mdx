### The Desperation Phase: Palm Pre & webOS (2008–2010)

#### Palm’s last hope: webOS (CES 2009)
Press reaction: “iPhone killer!” — and for a moment, it looked plausible.

**What webOS got right:**
- **Multitasking “Cards”**: see all apps at once, swipe away to close (iPhone didn’t multitask yet).
- **Gesture navigation**: swipe up from a gesture area; no physical home button.
- **Synergy**: merges Google, Facebook, Exchange into **one address book**.
- **Universal Search**: type to search apps, contacts, and the web.
- **Notifications**: actionable and subtle; better than iPhone’s at the time.

> webOS was genuinely good. Several ideas later appeared in iOS.

#### The Palm Pre (launched June 6, 2009)
**Specs:** 3.1" (320×480) display • slide-out **physical keyboard** • 8 GB storage • 3 MP camera • Sprint exclusive • **$199** on contract

**Design notes:** pebble-like shell, smooth slider, keyboard aimed at BlackBerry switchers.

**Contemporary reviews (common themes):**
- ✅ Best multitasking on any phone  
- ✅ Gesture navigation is brilliant  
- ✅ webOS is beautiful  
- ❌ Build quality felt shaky  
- ❌ Slider mechanism was flimsy  
- ❌ App selection was anemic

#### Why Pre failed (despite webOS)

**1) Too late to the party**
- iPhone: **June 2007** → App Store by 2008, massive mindshare by mid-2009.  
- Pre: **June 2009** — about **24 months late**.
- By mid-2009, iPhone had **50k+ apps** and **50M+ devices**; developer momentum was locked in.  
- Pre launched with **~30 apps**; devs weren’t biting.

**2) Sprint exclusivity**
- Limited audience while Sprint was losing subs to AT&T/Verizon.  
- When Pre finally reached Verizon (Jan 2010), the window had closed; Verizon pushed Android instead.

**3) Hardware issues**
- Slider prone to wobble (“**Oreo effect**”).  
- Touchstone wireless charger was cool, but felt like a gimmick against sturdier rivals.  
- Overall fit/finish lagged iPhone.

**4) The app gap**
- Developers prioritized **iOS** (and increasingly **Android**).  
- Many popular apps never arrived on webOS, pushing users elsewhere.

**5) Misfired marketing**
- The infamous “**Creepy Girl**” ads confused buyers.  
- Messaging couldn’t compete with Apple’s clarity and hype engine.

#### The numbers (and the cliff)
- **Year 1 (2009–2010):** Target ≈ **2M** units; actual ≈ **1M**. Losses ≈ **$740M**.  
- **Year 2 (2010):** Sales collapsed; stock slid from **$18 → $3**; layoffs accelerated.  
- Palm was effectively out of runway.
