### Why Palm Really Failed: The Full Autopsy

#### 1) Arrogance and denial (biggest factor)
- Palm invented the modern handheld and led the market for years.
- Success made them dismiss threats like the iPhone and Android.
- They didn’t want to kill their own PDA business by going “phone-first.”
- Famous bad takes:
  - “PC guys won’t figure out phones.” — Ed Colligan, 2006
  - “People need physical keyboards.” — various Palm execs, 2007
- Result: they acted like a winner while the game was changing.

#### 2) Too late to smartphones
- 2000–2006: phones got smarter; Palm stayed focused on PDAs.
- 2002: Treo arrived but wasn’t treated as the future.
- 2007: iPhone launches; Palm has no true answer.
- 2009: Palm Pre shows up about two and a half years late.
- If they’d gone all-in on Treo in 2002, they might have built a lead.

#### 3) Weak developer ecosystem by the time it mattered
- Palm had great apps in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
- They didn’t invest enough in tools and modern APIs.
- Developers moved to Windows Mobile, then iOS and Android.
- webOS launched with few apps; users followed the apps elsewhere.
- Lesson: without developers, a platform fades fast.

#### 4) Corporate dysfunction
- Six CEOs from 2001 to 2010; no steady strategy.
- Split into hardware (PalmOne) and software (PalmSource), then re-merged.
- Internal competition and mixed signals hurt focus.
- Founders and top engineers left; momentum died.

#### 5) Financial weakness
- Palm couldn’t fund long, expensive turnarounds.
- webOS was promising, but the company ran out of time and cash.
- Apple could afford years of iteration; Palm couldn’t survive one big miss.

#### 6) Execution problems
- Hardware: the Pre’s slider felt flimsy; durability issues (“oreo” twist).
- Software: webOS shipped buggy and slow; fixes came too slowly.
- Distribution: Sprint exclusivity at launch limited reach; Verizon support arrived after the moment had passed.

#### 7) Misaligned partners
- Microsoft years (Windows Mobile Treos) blurred Palm’s story and split focus.
- HP acquisition brought big promises but poor product/price decisions and a quick shutdown.

### What Palm should have done (the short version)
- 1999–2000: declare the phone the future; make Treo the core business.
- 2002–2005: rebuild Palm OS for multitasking, modern web, media, and better developer tools.
- 2006: launch a full-touch, modern OS device (a Pre-like phone) before iPhone.
- 2007 onward: move fast, ship yearly, go multi-carrier, price aggressively.

Instead, Palm moved slowly, underestimated rivals, shipped too late, and ran out of money.
