### The Death: HP Buyout & Shutdown (2010–2011)

#### April 2010 — HP acquires Palm
**Price:** **$1.2B**

**HP’s plan (on paper):**
- Use **webOS** to compete with the **iPad**.
- Ship **tablets, phones, maybe laptops** running webOS.
- Tie it all into HP’s **PC ecosystem** (synergy!).

**HP’s beliefs at the time:**
- “We need our own mobile OS.”
- “webOS might be **better than Android**” (debatable).
- “Integration with PCs will win.”
- “We can out-market Apple.” (…nope.)

#### July 2011 — The TouchPad disaster
**Product:** HP **TouchPad** (webOS 3.0)  
**Specs:** 9.7" screen • iPad 2 price: **$499**  
**Launch:** **July 1, 2011**

**Reviews (typical):**
- “It’s… fine.”
- “Not as good as iPad.”
- “webOS is nice, but **where are the apps?**”
- “Why pick this over iPad?”

**Sales reality:**
- **less than 50,000** units sold in **6 weeks**.
- HP made **~270,000**; **inventory piled up**.
- Retailers (e.g., Best Buy) couldn’t move stock and wanted returns.

#### August 18, 2011 — HP pulls the plug (49 days later)
HP announces:
- **Discontinuing** the TouchPad.
- **Shutting down** the Palm/webOS hardware group.
- **Exiting** mobile hardware.
- **Fire-sale** pricing: TouchPad cut to **$99**.

**Liquidation results:**
- At **$99**, units **sold out in hours**.
- Many bought them to **hack Android** onto the device.
- Proved **price**, not the core UX, was the main barrier—**but too late**.

**The irony:**
- Wouldn’t sell at **$499**; flew off shelves at **$99**.
- HP **lost money** on every unit.
- A sensible launch price might’ve been **$299**, but the moment had passed.

#### Final timeline & cost
- **Apr 28, 2010:** HP buys Palm (**$1.2B**).  
- **Jul 1, 2011:** TouchPad launches.  
- **Aug 18, 2011:** TouchPad killed; HP exits mobile hardware.  
- **Dec 2011:** Final Palm staff laid off.

**Elapsed:** ~**16 months** from acquisition to shutdown.  
**HP’s total loss:** **>$3B** (acquisition, development, write-offs).

#### What happened to webOS afterward?
- **2013:** HP sells **webOS to LG** (~**$25M**).
- **Today:** LG uses webOS in **smart TVs** (millions of sets).  
- **Takeaway:** Palm’s **mobile OS survived**—just **on televisions**, not phones.
