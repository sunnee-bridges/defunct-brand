### Opening Hook

> **TL;DR:** Palm Pilot ruled handhelds from **1996–2007** (50M+ units; ~70% share). It lost by underprioritizing phones, shipping an aging OS too long, and moving too slowly once the **iPhone (2007)** reset expectations. **webOS (2009)** was brilliant but late; **HP** bought Palm in **2010** and shut hardware in **2011**.

In **1996**, if you were important—or wanted to look important—you had a **Palm Pilot** on your belt. It wasn’t just a gadget; it was the first pocket device that made **calendars, contacts, and notes** truly useful. While others lugged paper planners, Palm users pressed **one HotSync button** and their life stayed in lockstep.

By **2000**, Palm held **~70%** of the PDA market and was valued higher than **General Motors**. Then, in **2007**, Steve Jobs unveiled the **iPhone**, and the standalone PDA became a museum piece almost overnight.

So what happened? How did the company that popularized pocket touchscreens get outpaced by a touchscreen phone?
