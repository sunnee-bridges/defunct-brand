### The Expansion: Different Palm Brands (1999–2005)

#### Why were there so many “Palm” devices?
Palm didn’t just make Palm Pilots—it **licensed Palm OS** to other companies, which grew the ecosystem but also **fragmented** it.

#### The main players

**Handspring (1998–2003)**
- Founded by **Jeff Hawkins** and **Donna Dubinsky** (Palm’s original creators)
- Signature devices: **Visor**, **Treo**
- Innovation: **Springboard** expansion slot for add-ons  
- **Treo (2002)** highlights:
  - Palm OS smartphone with **keyboard + touchscreen**
  - *Could have led the smartphone era*, but was **early, pricey, and niche**

**Sony CLIE (2000–2005)**
- High-end Palm OS line with:
  - **Better displays** (color, higher resolution)
  - **Multimedia** features (MP3, cameras)
  - Premium **industrial design**
- Downsides: **Expensive**, and Sony exited in **2005**

#### Palm’s own product lines

**m series (2001–2003)**
- **m500, m505** (color screens), **m130** (budget)
- **SD/MMC** card expansion

**Tungsten series (2002–2006)**
- Higher-end: faster CPUs, better screens, **Bluetooth**
- **Tungsten T5 (2004)** often cited as the **last great PDA**

**Zire series (2002–2005)**

#### The corporate tangle (2000–2005)

**Split (2000)**
- **PalmOne**: hardware  
- **PalmSource**: Palm OS software  
- Problem: the two **competed indirectly**—PalmSource licensed to Sony/Handspring while PalmOne sold devices against those licensees.

**Merge (2003)**
- **Handspring + PalmOne** reunited founders and the Treo line  
- But the market was already **shifting toward phones**

**Rebrand (2005)**
- Back to **Palm, Inc.** to simplify—yet the **brand confusion** and **lost time** had already taken a toll.
