### The Legacy: What Palm Got Right

Palm shipped ideas that still shape smartphones today.

#### 1) Touchscreen mobile interfaces (1996)
- Proved small, pen/touch screens could work.
- Mocked at first; now every phone is touch-first.
- Palm was early by roughly a decade.

#### 2) A real mobile app ecosystem (1998)
- Thriving third-party apps long before “App Store” was a thing.
- Downloads, reviews, recommendations, customization.
- Set the pattern others later mainstreamed.

#### 3) One-button sync (HotSync, 1996)
- Press once, everything updates.
- Automatic backups and painless transfers.
- Today’s iCloud/Google sync is the same spirit, just cloud-based.

#### 4) Gesture-based interfaces (webOS, 2009)
- Card multitasking, swipe navigation, no physical home button.
- Concepts later echoed in modern iOS/Android UI.

#### 5) The “always-on” digital life
- Normalized carrying calendars, contacts, notes everywhere.
- Shifted habits from paper planners to digital organization.

#### 6) Touchstone wireless charging (2009)
- Drop-to-charge dock years before it became common.
- Magnetic alignment and desk-friendly charging.

> Irony: Palm pioneered many of these features—and still lost to companies that executed and scaled them better.
