### What Was the Palm Pilot? 
#### The Revolutionary 1996 Device

The first Palm Pilot launched in April 1996 by Palm Computing (later acquired by 3Com). It was revolutionary for its time:

**Original Palm Pilot Specs (1996):**
- Monochrome touchscreen (160×160 pixels)
- 128KB–512KB memory (yes, kilobytes!)
- Stylus-based input
- Price: $299–$499
- Size: fits in a shirt pocket

**What made it different from competitors:**
- ✅ Actually fit in a pocket (Newton was huge)
- ✅ Instant-on (no boot time)
- ✅ Week-long battery life (2 AAA batteries)
- ✅ Simple, focused features
- ✅ One-button sync with desktop computer

**The Killer Feature: HotSync**  
Place the Palm in a cradle connected to your PC/Mac, press one button, and calendar/contacts/notes sync instantly. In 1996, that was mind-blowing: before Palm, you entered data twice—once on the computer, once in the paper planner.

**Who bought Palm Pilots:**
- Business executives (digital Rolodex)
- Doctors (patient notes, drug references)
- Sales professionals (client tracking)
- Lawyers (case notes, appointments)
- Tech enthusiasts (early adopters)

Culturally, having a Palm Pilot clipped to your belt was like having the latest iPhone today—a status symbol that said “I’m tech-savvy and important.”

**Key stat:** **Over 50 million Palm devices sold worldwide.**
