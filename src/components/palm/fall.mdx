### The Beginning of the End: Palm’s Fatal Mistakes (2003–2007)

#### Mistake 1 — Dismissing the phone threat ⚠️
**The signs (2002–2006):**
- **BlackBerry** was taking over business: push email + hardware keyboard.
- Users wanted **one device**, not a PDA *and* a phone.
- **Windows Mobile** phones were improving fast (Motorola Q, AT&T Tilt).

**Palm’s response:**
- Launched **Treo** but treated it like a **PDA that makes calls**, not a phone-first product.
- Pricing was high, hardware felt clunky vs. BlackBerry.
- Internal mindset: “We do PDAs; phones are someone else’s business.”

**Outcome:** Phones ate PDAs. Palm ceded the future.

#### Mistake 2 — Letting Palm OS go obsolete
**By 2005, Palm OS struggled:**
- Built for **simple 1996 PDAs**.
- **No true multitasking** (one app at a time).
- Weak **browser** and **multimedia**.
- **Security** gaps and **devs drifting** to other platforms.
- UI looked **dated** next to rivals.

**Competitor reality (2003–2007):**
- **Windows Mobile** offered multitasking, Office, and IT-friendly features.

**Palm’s moves:**
- Worked on **Palm OS 6 (Cobalt)** but never shipped it.
- Shipped some **Windows Mobile Treos**—a tacit admission the in-house OS had fallen behind.

#### Mistake 3 — Corporate chaos
**Whiplash years:**
- **2001–2005:** about **five CEOs** with shifting strategies.
- **2000 split:** **PalmOne** (hardware) vs. **PalmSource** (OS) created internal misalignment.
- **2003 merge with Handspring; 2005** rebrand back to **Palm, Inc.**
- Founders, including **Jeff Hawkins**, eventually left; **brain drain** followed.

**Result:** Strategy changed faster than products could ship.

#### Mistake 4 — Underestimating iPhone (the fatal error)
**Jan 2007:** iPhone unveiled. Palm leadership publicly doubted “PC guys.”

**Palm misread:**
- Assumed **no keyboard** would fail.
- Dismissed **capacitive touch** and a **full web browser** as fads.
- Ignored the coming **App Store ecosystem** and consumer pull.

**What actually happened:**
- **June 2007:** iPhone launch **redefined smartphones**.
- Treo looked **instantly dated**; panic at Palm.
- Market share slid fast:
  - **~10% (2006)** → **~2% (2008)** → **less than 1% (2010)**

#### Mistake 5 — Moving too slowly
**Apple cadence:**
- **2007:** iPhone  
- **2008:** iPhone 3G + App Store  
- **2009:** iPhone 3GS

**Palm cadence:**
- **2007:** Treo 755p (felt like a 2004 design)
- **2008:** Treo Pro (minor catch-up)
- **2009:** **Palm Pre** (finally modern, but late)

**Bottom line:** By the time Palm answered, Apple was **three generations ahead**.
