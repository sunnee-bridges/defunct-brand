# 10 Discontinued Drinks from the 90s We Still Miss (And Where They Went)

The 1990s were the golden age of weird, wonderful, and wildly experimental beverages. Soda companies tried clear colas, floating gelatin balls, and extreme citrus flavors. Juice brands went hyper-colorful. Energy drinks were just emerging. And then, almost as quickly as they appeared, most of these drinks vanished.

If you grew up in the 90s, you probably have strong feelings about at least one discontinued drink from this list. These beverages weren't just thirst-quenchers—they were cultural artifacts, status symbols, and taste memories that defined a generation.

Here are 10 discontinued drinks from the 90s that we still miss, and the stories behind why they disappeared.

---

## 1. Surge (1997–2003)
**What it was:** Coca-Cola’s extreme-citrus answer to Mountain Dew.  
**Why we miss it:** High-caffeine, LAN-party fuel with over-the-top 90s ads.  
**What happened:** Discontinued in 2003; fan pressure led to limited comebacks starting 2014.

---

## 2. Crystal Pepsi (1992–1993)
**What it was:** Clear cola in the era of “purity” marketing.  
**Why we miss it:** It felt futuristic—seeing cola taste in a clear liquid.  
**What happened:** Curiosity spike, then steep drop; occasional nostalgia reissues since 2015.

---

## 3. Orbitz (1997–1998)
**What it was:** Fruit drinks with floating gelatin spheres (lava-lamp vibes).  
**Why we miss it:** Nothing before or since looked like this.  
**What happened:** One-and-done novelty; texture turned off repeat buyers.

---

## 4. Snapple Elements (1999–2002)
**What it was:** Rain, Sun, Fire, Earth in wide-mouth bottles.  
**Why we miss it:** Design + flavors = peak dorm-shelf collectible.  
**What happened:** Costly packaging and vending incompatibility; cut in portfolio trims.

## 5. Fruitopia (1994–2003, U.S.)
**What it was:** Psychedelic fruit drinks with New Age copy.  
**Why we miss it:** Iconic labels and maximal 90s sweetness.  
**What happened:** Health trends and dated positioning; survives in Canada/AU/NZ.

---

## 6. OK Soda (1993–1995)
**What it was:** Coke’s “anti-brand” for Gen-X, with Daniel Clowes/Charles Burns art.  
**Why we miss it:** The most fascinating brand experiment of the decade.  
**What happened:** Niche concept never scaled beyond test markets.

---

## 7. Jolt Cola (peak 90s)
**What it was:** “All the sugar and twice the caffeine.”  
**Why we miss it:** Proto-energy drink before energy drinks.  
**What happened:** Ownership churn and competition; scattered revivals, not the same.

---

## 8. Clearly Canadian (peak 90s)
**What it was:** Premium sparkling water in jewel-like glass bottles.  
**Why we miss it:** Fruity, fizzy, and proudly non-soda.  
**What happened:** Distribution struggles; Kickstarter revival in 2015 with limited reach.

---

## 9. Snapple Whipper Snapple (1998–2000)
**What it was:** Shelf-stable smoothies (Strawberry Banana, Orange Dream, Peach Mango).  
**Why we miss it:** Thick, creamy, ahead of the bottled-smoothie boom.  
**What happened:** Short promo run; category exploded just after it disappeared.

## 10. Mello Yello (the 90s vibe)
**What it was:** Citrus soda that many swear tasted better back then.  
**Why we miss it:** Regional cult favorite, overshadowed by Surge.  
**What happened:** Still exists, but reformulations + limited distribution dulled the magic.

---

## Why So Many Vanished

**Ownership changes:** each new parent trims the long tail.  
**Shelf economics:** limited cooler space; winners crowd out experiments.  
**Health shifts:** less sugar, simpler labels; many formulas reworked or cut.  
**Novelty decay:** curiosity sells once; only a few become habits.  
**Competition:** energy drinks, craft sodas, kombucha, and premium teas squeezed the middle.

---

## Will They Come Back?

Sometimes—as **limited editions** or online exclusives. Nostalgia is real, but small runs, higher costs, and today’s distribution hurdles make permanent returns rare.
