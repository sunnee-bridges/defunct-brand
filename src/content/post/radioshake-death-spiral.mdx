1. "What Really Happened to RadioShack? The Death Spiral Nobody Saw Coming"
The Mystery Hook:

How does a 94-year-old electronics empire collapse seemingly overnight?
Were they killed by Amazon, or did they commit slow suicide?

The Intrigue:

They hired a celebrity DJ (Shaquille O'Neal) as their "Chief Surprise Officer" in 2015... while going bankrupt
The infamous 2014 Super Bowl commercial mocking their own outdated image
Internal emails revealed executives had NO idea what they were selling
The bizarre zombie existence: declared bankruptcy in 2015, 2017, and still somehow has stores

Mystery Elements:

The smoking gun: Refused to embrace online sales until 2000 (Amazon started 1994)
The weird pivot: Tried to become a phone kiosk for Sprint/Verizon
The unanswered question: Why did they ignore DECADES of warnings?

Reveal: Death by a thousand cuts—stubbornness, corporate denial, and thinking they could survive without evolving.
