Remember when grocery shopping felt like an adventure? When you'd sprint down the snack aisle hoping that one product you loved hadn't sold out? These discontinued foods haunt our dreams and dominate our “bring it back” petitions. Unlike the lucky few that made comebacks, these products remain lost to time—and we're still not over it.

## 1) Altoids Sours (2001–2010)

**What they were:** Intensely sour candy in those iconic metal tins. Flavors included Tangerine, Citrus, Apple, Raspberry, and Mango.  
**Why we miss them:** Not your average sour—they were **AGGRESSIVELY** sour. Face-scrunching, eye-watering, a pocket-sized badge of honor.  
**The betrayal:** Wrigley discontinued them in 2010 for “low demand.” Fans called BS. Empty tins go for $20–$50 on eBay. Petitions galore.  
**The cult following:** New Reddit threads pop up constantly. DIY clones abound; “close, not the same.”  
**Will they return?** Unlikely. Mars (current owner) stays silent. Fifteen years later… silence is still the answer.

## 2) PB Crisps (1992–1995)

**What they were:** Peanut-shaped cookies filled with peanut butter from Planters. Mr. Peanut made a cookie of himself—meta and delicious.  
**Why we miss them:** Only **three years**, yet generational impact. Light, crispy shell + creamy PB filling = perfect sweet-salty harmony.  
**The betrayal:** Quietly discontinued in 1995. No explanation.  
**The cult following:** “Most missed snack” in endless polls. Facebook groups with thousands beg for a return.  
**Will they return?** Planters has repeatedly said no. Recipe/process speculation persists. Hope flickers on.

## 3) Ecto Cooler (1987–2001; brief 2016 return)

**What it was:** Hi-C’s Ghostbusters tie-in. Bright green tangerine drink with Slimer on the box.  
**Why we miss it:** Outlasted the movies by a decade; an entire generation grew up with it in lunchboxes.  
**The betrayal:** Discontinued in 2001; rebranded as *Shoutin’ Orange Tangergreen* (no magic).  
**The brief tease:** Came back for the 2016 reboot, sold out instantly, then vanished again.  
**Will it return?** Maybe with another Ghostbusters film. Until then, we wait in green-tinted despair.

## 4) Butterfinger BB’s (1992–2006)

**What they were:** Bite-sized Butterfinger balls; peak Bart Simpson era.  
**Why we miss them:** Better chocolate-to-crisp ratio than the bar; perfect movie snack; fewer crumb issues.  
**The betrayal:** Replaced by *Mini Bites* in 2009. **Not the same.**  
**The cult following:** Groups, petitions, nostalgia sites—BB’s truthers are steadfast.  
**Will they return?** Ferrara says Mini Bites are equivalent. Fans: “we disagree.”

## 5) Orbitz Drink (1997–1998)

**What it was:** A clear beverage with floating gel orbs—a drinkable lava lamp from Clearly Canadian.  
**Why we miss it:** Unhinged in the best way. Flavors like *Raspberry Citrus* and *Vanilla Orange*.  
**The betrayal:** Lasted one year; consumers bewildered, sales tanked.  
**The fascination:** Concept > taste. We miss the audacity.  
**Will it return?** No. The legend only grows.

## 6) Squeezit (1985–2001)

**What they were:** Colorful squeeze-bottle fruit drinks; the bottle was half the fun.  
**Why we miss them:** The **squeeze** satisfaction and the character bottles; trading flavors at lunch.  
**The betrayal:** Discontinued in 2001; a 2006 recyclable-bottle revival fizzled.  
**Will they return?** Doubtful—packaging concerns + the magic was the original bottle.

## 7) Kudos Granola Bars (1986–2017)

**What they were:** Candy bars disguised as granola bars (M&M’s, chocolate chip, more).  
**Why we miss them:** The sweet spot between “snack” and “dessert.” Parents fooled, kids delighted.  
**The betrayal:** Quietly discontinued in 2017 after 31 years.  
**The cult following:** Millennials with buying power are ready—Mars isn’t.  
**Will they return?** No movement so far.

## 8) Wonder Ball (1997–2004; 2016–2019)

**What it was:** Chocolate ball with toys (later candy) inside. “Oh I wonder, wonder…”  
**Why we miss it:** The **surprise**—cracking it open never got old.  
**The legal drama:** Original toy version pulled over safety concerns; later candy-only returns kept sputtering out.  
**Will it return?** It boomerangs every few years… and then vanishes. Trust issues remain.

## 9) Hubba Bubba Bubble Jug (1980s–2012)

**What it was:** Powdered bubble gum you poured into your mouth that turned to gum as you chewed.  
**Why we miss it:** Weird science! Powder → gum. Instant playground spectacle.  
**The betrayal:** Discontinued around 2012 with no farewell.  
**The cult following:** “Did I dream this?” threads abound; confirmation brings joy and pain.  
**Will it return?** Highly unlikely—too odd for modern lineups.

## 10) Chiclets Gum (1906–2016, US)

**What they were:** Candy-coated squares in the iconic yellow box; over a century of history.  
**Why we miss them:** A whole aesthetic—rainbow colors, the crunch, “Chiclet teeth.”  
**The betrayal:** Discontinued in the U.S. after 110 years.  
**Will they return?** Still sold in some countries; U.S. fans rely on imports.

## Why these still haven’t come back

**Manufacturing issues:**  
- Original recipes/processes lost or expensive to reproduce  
- Packaging no longer viable (e.g., Squeezit bottles)  
- Ingredients discontinued or reformulated

**Corporate indifference:**  
- Ownership changes and reorgs  
- Focus on “new” over legacy nostalgia plays  
- No internal champion who remembers *why* it mattered

**Legal concerns:**  
- Safety standards (e.g., toy-in-chocolate for Wonder Ball)

**Cultural shifts:**  
- Weird concepts don’t test well now (Orbitz)  
- Health consciousness killed “granola candy bars” (Kudos)

## The ones that almost made this list (but returned)

- **Dunkaroos** — RETURNED 2020 (recipe debates continue)  
- **French Toast Crunch** — RETURNED 2014  
- **Planters Cheez Balls** — RETURNED 2018  
- **Surge** — RETURNED 2014 (limited)  
- **3D Doritos** — RETURNED 2021 as *3D Crunch* (fans say it’s different)

## What you can do

- Sign petitions (Change.org has active campaigns)  
- Tag brands relentlessly — **@Mars @Planters @Wrigley @Nestlé**  
- Join Facebook groups — your voice is louder together  
- Share memories — nostalgia posts travel far  
- Vote with your wallet — support similar launches to send a demand signal

## The cold hard truth

Most of these will never return. Companies moved on. Recipes are lost. Lines were dismantled. But we keep hoping—because these weren’t just snacks; they were **time machines**. One bite took you back to lunch tables, summer afternoons, or movie nights with friends.

**Which discontinued food haunts *your* dreams?**  
Did we miss one? Drop a comment and share your pain—misery loves company, and we’re all still mourning.

*UPDATED 2025 — Still waiting. Still hoping. Still signing petitions.* 🙏
