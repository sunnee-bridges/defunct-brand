> **TL;DR:** Palm Pilot dominated handheld computing from 1996–2007 (50M+ devices, ~70% PDA share). It fell by prioritizing PDAs over phones, shipping obsolete Palm OS too long, moving slowly against the iPhone, and suffering leadership chaos. Palm’s 2009 webOS was brilliant but late; HP bought Palm in 2010 and shut down the hardware business in 2011.
