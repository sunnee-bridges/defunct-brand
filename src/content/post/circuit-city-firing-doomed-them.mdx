"What Really Happened to Circuit City? The Firing That Doomed Them"
The Mystery Hook:

Circuit City was BEATING Best Buy in the early 2000s
Then they made one catastrophic decision
18 months later, they were bankrupt

The Intrigue:

March 2007: Circuit City fires 3,400 of their highest-paid (most experienced) salespeople
Replaced them with minimum-wage employees who knew nothing
Customer service tanked overnight
The CEO said it was to "reduce costs" (they saved $110 million)
Cost them EVERYTHING

Mystery Elements:

The smoking gun: Internal emails show executives KNEW this was risky
The domino effect: Loss of expertise → worse service → customers fled to Best Buy
The arrogance: Management thought salespeople were replaceable

Other bad decisions:

Launched DIVX (their own DVD format) instead of supporting DVD—customers hated it
Refused to match online prices
Terrible website while Best Buy invested heavily online

Reveal: They committed suicide by firing their best people to save pennies while losing dollars.
