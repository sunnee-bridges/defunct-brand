"What Really Happened to Tower Records? The Founder Who Couldn't Let Go"
The Mystery Hook:

Tower Records was the music destination worldwide
Stores in 15 countries, $1 billion in revenue
Then founder Russ Solomon made one fatal mistake

The Intrigue:

Solomon refused to adapt to digital music
Spent lavishly on store expansions in the 2000s (AFTER Napster)
Treated music retail like it was still 1985
Competitors (Best Buy, Walmart) sold CDs as loss leaders to drive traffic
Tower couldn't compete on price but refused to compete on experience
Filed bankruptcy 2004, liquidated 2006

Mystery Elements:

The stubborn founder: Solomon was 79 and wouldn't change
The missed opportunity: They COULD have been the music expert destination (like Apple Store became)
The Japanese twist: Tower Records Japan bought the rights and still operates successfully there

Reveal: The founder loved music too much to see the business clearly. Nostalgia killed Tower Records.
