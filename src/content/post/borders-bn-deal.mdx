"What Really Happened to Borders Books? The Barnes & Noble Deal That Sealed Their Fate"
The Mystery Hook:

Borders and Barnes & Noble were neck-and-neck in the 1990s
Both faced the same Amazon threat
Barnes & Noble survived. Borders died. Why?

The Intrigue:

2001: Borders outsourced their entire website to... AMAZON
Let their biggest competitor run their e-commerce for 7 years
Barnes & Noble built their own website and created the Nook e-reader
Borders woke up in 2008 and tried to build a website—too late
By the time they tried to compete digitally, Amazon had won

Mystery Elements:

The WTF moment: Why would you let Amazon run your website?!
The missed opportunity: They were actually AHEAD of B&N in the 90s (bigger stores, better selection)
The question: Did Amazon deliberately sabotage them?

Reveal: Borders outsourced their future to their competitor. When they realized the mistake, it was too late.
