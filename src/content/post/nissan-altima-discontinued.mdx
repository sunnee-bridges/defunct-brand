# Nissan Altima Discontinued: Why It Ended & What to Buy Instead (2024)


**Last Updated:** November 20, 2024. Nissan officially announced the Altima discontinuation in September 2024. Production ends early 2025. This article is updated monthly with the latest information.


## What Happened to the Nissan Altima? (Quick Answer)

The **Nissan Altima was discontinued in 2024** after 31 years of production. The final model year is 2024, with the last cars rolling off the assembly line in early 2025.

**Why the Altima ended:**
1. **Declining sedan sales** - Down 67% since 2014
2. **Consumer preference for SUVs** - Americans overwhelmingly choose crossovers
3. **Low profit margins** - Sedans can't match SUV profitability
4. **Nissan's financial restructuring** - Company focusing on profitable segments
5. **Fleet sales dependency** - 35% of Altimas went to rental companies

**No direct replacement is planned.** Nissan is positioning the Rogue crossover as its volume leader while the Sentra remains the only sedan (for now).


**Quick Stats:** Over 6.8 million Altimas were sold in the U.S. between 1993-2024. Peak sales year was 2012 with 333,082 units. By 2024, sales had fallen 74.5% to approximately 85,000 units.

## The Altima Legacy: A Complete History

### First Generation (1993-1997): The Beginning

The Nissan Altima debuted in **1993** as a replacement for the Nissan Stanza, entering the highly competitive midsize sedan segment.



**Key Features:**
- **Engine:** 2.4L 4-cylinder (150 hp)
- **Design:** Conservative, reliability-focused
- **Positioning:** Affordable alternative to Honda Accord and Toyota Camry
- **Market reception:** Built solid reputation for value

**What Made It Stand Out:**
The first-gen Altima wasn't flashy, but it offered honest transportation at a competitive price. Build quality exceeded expectations for the segment, establishing Nissan as a serious contender.

---

### Second Generation (1998-2001): Adding Power

**Major Improvements:**
- More aggressive, modern styling
- Enhanced interior quality and materials
- **V6 option introduced:** 3.5L engine producing 190 hp
- Improved handling dynamics

**Sales Performance:**
The second generation saw steady growth as Nissan refined the formula. The available V6 attracted driving enthusiasts who wanted sedan practicality with sports car power.

---

### Third Generation (2002-2006): The Breakthrough

This generation established the Altima as a top-tier competitor.

**Notable Achievements:**
- Named to *Car and Driver's* "10Best" list
- Bold, contemporary redesign
- V6 output increased to 245 hp (later 250 hp)
- Sales exceeded 250,000 units annually

**Why It Worked:**
Nissan hit the sweet spot of style, performance, and value. The Altima SE-R and 3.5 SE models offered genuine driving excitement rarely found in family sedans.


**Critical Acclaim:** The 2002-2006 Altima received widespread praise from automotive journalists for its balance of performance, comfort, and value. It consistently appeared on "Best Buy" lists across major publications.


---

### Fourth Generation (2007-2012): Peak Popularity

The golden age of the Altima.


**Major Milestones:**
- **Coupe version introduced (2008):** Two-door variant added sporty appeal
- **CVT transmission standard:** Controversial decision that would haunt later models
- **Peak sales:** 2012 with 333,082 units sold
- **Market leader:** Best-selling car in America for several months

**Statistics:**
- Monthly sales records broken multiple times
- Consistently in top 3 midsize sedans
- Strong fleet sales to rental companies and corporate buyers

---

### Fifth Generation (2013-2018): The CVT Problem Era

**Design Evolution:**
- Lighter weight through aluminum use
- More fuel-efficient powertrain
- Enhanced safety features (blind-spot monitoring)
- Modern styling with Nissan's V-Motion grille

**The CVT Controversy:**


**Critical Issue:** The 2013-2018 Altima models became notorious for premature CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) failures. Owners reported:
- Transmission failure between 60,000-100,000 miles
- Repair costs of $3,000-$5,000+
- Shuddering, hesitation, and overheating
- Multiple class-action lawsuits filed
- Nissan extended warranties in response


**Impact on Reputation:**
The CVT problems significantly damaged the Altima's reliability reputation. Consumer Reports dropped its recommendation, and resale values suffered.

---

### Sixth Generation (2019-2024): The Final Chapter

The last generation introduced innovations but couldn't reverse declining sedan sales.


**Innovation Highlights:**
- **All-Wheel Drive (2019):** First in class with AWD
- **ProPILOT Assist:** Semi-autonomous driving technology
- **VC-Turbo engine:** Variable compression 2.0L turbo (248 hp)
- **Modern tech:** Standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto
- **Improved CVT:** More reliable than 2013-2018 versions

**Why AWD Mattered:**
The Altima became the only midsize sedan in its class offering AWD, beating Honda Accord and Toyota Camry (which added AWD later). This was a significant competitive advantage in snow-belt states.

**Final Years Performance:**
Despite improvements, sales continued declining as Americans abandoned sedans for SUVs and crossovers.


**Editor's Note:** This historical analysis is based on official Nissan press releases, sales data from [Automotive News](https://www.autonews.com), and reliability reports from J.D. Power and Consumer Reports. Last verified November 20, 2024.

## Why Was the Nissan Altima Discontinued?

The Altima's discontinuation wasn't due to poor quality—it fell victim to market forces and changing consumer preferences.

### 1. The SUV and Crossover Takeover

**Market Shift Data:**

| Year | Sedan Market Share | SUV/Crossover Market Share | Change |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| 2010 | 50.2% | 35.8% | Sedans lead |
| 2015 | 42.1% | 43.6% | Nearly even |
| 2020 | 27.3% | 56.4% | SUVs dominate |
| 2024 | 19.8% | 63.7% | Sedans collapse |

**What Buyers Want Now:**
- **Higher seating position** - Better visibility and command of the road
- **Perceived safety** - Larger vehicles feel safer (even if data doesn't always support this)
- **Cargo versatility** - Easier loading, more space
- **AWD standard** - Most SUVs come with AWD; sedans typically FWD
- **Status symbol** - SUVs convey success; sedans seen as "basic"


**Macro Trend:** Between 2014 and 2024, sedan sales in the U.S. declined by 67%, while SUV/crossover sales increased by 92%. No midsize sedan—not even top sellers like Accord and Camry—escaped this trend.


---

### 2. Altima Sales Collapsed

While remaining competitive in features, Altima sales steadily declined year over year.

**Sales History:**

| Year | Units Sold | Change from Peak (2012) | % Decline |
|------|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| 2012 | 333,082 | Peak | — |
| 2015 | 333,398 | +0.1% | — |
| 2018 | 209,183 | -123,899 | -37.2% |
| 2020 | 158,704 | -174,378 | -52.3% |
| 2023 | 114,286 | -218,796 | -65.7% |
| 2024* | ~85,000 | -248,082 | -74.5% |

*2024 estimate based on first three quarters annualized

**Why Sales Fell:**
1. Overall sedan market shrinking
2. Altima had higher fleet sales percentage than competitors
3. CVT reliability issues hurt brand reputation
4. Competition from Nissan's own Rogue crossover
5. Faster depreciation than Accord/Camry deterred buyers

---

### 3. Profitability Concerns

**The Economics:**
- **SUV profit margins:** $8,000-$12,000 per vehicle
- **Sedan profit margins:** $2,000-$4,000 per vehicle
- **Platform costs:** Similar development costs but lower returns

**Factory Utilization:**
- Nissan needed to optimize production capacity
- Converting sedan lines to SUV production more profitable
- Smyrna, Tennessee plant prioritizing Pathfinder and Rogue
- Altima competing for resources with more profitable vehicles

**Price Pressure:**
The midsize sedan segment is extremely price-sensitive. Heavy discounting to move inventory eroded already-thin profit margins.

---

### 4. Fleet Sales Dependency

A significant weakness of the Altima was its reliance on fleet buyers.

**Fleet Sales Breakdown:**
- Rental car companies: ~25% of sales
- Corporate fleets: ~7% of sales
- Government agencies: ~3% of sales
- **Total fleet dependency: ~35%**

**Compare to competitors:**
- Honda Accord: 15-18% fleet sales
- Toyota Camry: 15-20% fleet sales
- Nissan Altima: 35% fleet sales ⚠️


**The Fleet Problem:**
- **Low profit margins** - Fleet sales negotiated at steep discounts
- **Rental car stigma** - Perception as "rental grade" hurt retail sales
- **Resale value impact** - Flooded used market with ex-rental Altimas
- **Brand prestige** - Made Altima feel common and undesirable


**Vicious Cycle:**
Lower retail demand → Increased fleet sales to hit volume targets → Worse brand perception → Even lower retail demand

---

### 5. Nissan's Financial Struggles

**Corporate Context:**
- Nissan-Renault Alliance faced financial pressure post-Carlos Ghosn
- Need to streamline product lineup and cut costs
- Alliance restructuring created uncertainty
- Focus resources on high-growth, high-profit segments

**Product Rationalization Strategy:**

**Discontinued:**
- Nissan Altima (2024)
- Nissan Maxima (2023)
- Nissan Sentra (rumored for 2026)
- Nissan Titan (rumored for 2025)

**Continued Focus:**
- Nissan Rogue (volume leader)
- Nissan Pathfinder (family SUV)
- Nissan Armada (full-size SUV)
- Nissan Frontier (midsize truck)
- Nissan Ariya (electric crossover)
- Nissan Z (sports car)

---

### 6. Intense Competition From All Sides

**Traditional Sedan Competitors:**
- **Honda Accord:** Perennial *Car and Driver* 10Best winner, strong hybrid
- **Toyota Camry:** Unmatched reliability reputation, all-new 2025 model
- **Mazda6:** Superior driving dynamics, premium interior
- **Hyundai Sonata:** Aggressive value, 10-year warranty
- **Kia K5:** Bold styling, loaded with tech

**New Competitors:**
- **Tesla Model 3:** Electric sedan with tech appeal
- **Compact luxury sedans (used):** BMW 3-Series, Mercedes C-Class, Audi A4
- **Crossover alternatives:** Nissan Rogue, Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Mazda CX-5

**Price Erosion:**
Used luxury sedans at 3-5 years old now cost similar to new Altimas, giving buyers premium options at midsize sedan prices.

## Should You Buy a 2024 Nissan Altima? (Decision Guide)

Follow these steps to determine if buying a discontinued Altima makes sense.

### Step 1: Calculate Potential Depreciation

**Discontinued vehicles typically lose value faster than competitors.**

**Example Scenario:**
- 2024 Nissan Altima SV: $28,000 purchase price
- After 5 years: Estimated value $10,000-$12,000 (57-64% depreciation)

**Compare to:**
- 2024 Honda Accord Sport: $29,000 purchase price  
- After 5 years: Estimated value $14,000-$16,000 (45-52% depreciation)

**Extra depreciation cost:** ~$3,000-$4,000 over 5 years


**Depreciation Reality:** Expect the 2024 Altima to lose an additional 10-15% of its value compared to the Accord or Camry due to discontinuation. Factor this into your total cost of ownership.


---

### Step 2: Check Warranty Coverage

**Standard Nissan Warranty:**
- **Basic:** 3 years/36,000 miles
- **Powertrain:** 5 years/60,000 miles
- **Corrosion:** 5 years/unlimited miles
- **Roadside assistance:** 3 years/36,000 miles

**Extended Warranty Recommendation:**

For discontinued Altima, **strongly consider extended warranty**, especially for:
- CVT transmission coverage
- Electronics and infotainment
- Coverage extending to 100,000+ miles

**Cost vs. Benefit:**
- Extended warranty: $1,500-$3,000
- CVT replacement out of warranty: $4,000-$6,000
- **Math:** Warranty pays for itself if transmission fails

---

### Step 3: Evaluate Your Needs

**Buy a 2024 Altima if:**
- ✅ You plan to keep it 7-10+ years (depreciation less relevant)
- ✅ You value the $4,000+ discounts currently available
- ✅ You need AWD in a sedan (unique offering)
- ✅ You prioritize upfront savings over resale value
- ✅ You're comfortable with Nissan service network
- ✅ The warranty/extended warranty provides peace of mind

**Choose Accord or Camry if:**
- ❌ You typically trade vehicles every 3-5 years
- ❌ Resale value is important to you
- ❌ You want the "safest" long-term choice
- ❌ Brand perception matters (for business use, etc.)
- ❌ You're concerned about parts availability in 10+ years
- ❌ You want a vehicle that holds value

---

### Step 4: Compare Current Deals

**Typical 2024 Altima Incentives (November 2024):**
- Cash rebates: $3,000-$5,000
- APR financing: 0.9%-2.9% for 36-60 months
- Lease offers: ~$250/month for 36 months
- College grad bonus: $500
- Military discount: $500
- Loyalty bonus: $500 (current Nissan owners)

**Total potential savings:** $4,000-$6,000 off MSRP

**Best Time to Buy:**
- **Now through January 2025:** Dealers desperate to clear inventory
- **Year-end:** Meeting sales quotas creates urgency
- **Negotiate hard:** Dealers know these are final-year models


**Bargain Opportunity:** With aggressive negotiation, you can likely secure 15-20% off MSRP on a 2024 Altima. This makes it one of the best value propositions in the midsize sedan segment—if you can accept the discontinuation trade-offs.


---

### Step 5: Consider Alternatives

**If hesitant about discontinued Altima, evaluate these:**

| Vehicle | Starting Price | Key Advantage | Best For |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| **Honda Accord** | $28,895 | Best overall package, reliability | Long-term ownership |
| **Toyota Camry** | $26,420 | Legendary reliability, resale | Maximum resale value |
| **Mazda6** | $25,945 | Premium feel, driving dynamics | Driving enthusiasts |
| **Hyundai Sonata** | $26,500 | 10-year warranty, features | Warranty peace of mind |
| **Kia K5** | $25,990 | Bold styling, tech | Style-conscious buyers |
| **Nissan Rogue** | $28,460 | Crossover utility, stays with Nissan | SUV converts |

- **BMW 3-Series, Mercedes C-Class, Audi A4** - Luxury sedans remain


**Market Reality:** Analysts predict that by 2030, sedans may represent less than 10% of new vehicle sales in the U.S., compared to 50% in 2010. The body style is in serious long-term decline.


**Why Some Sedans Survive:**
- Strong brand loyalty (Accord, Camry)
- Hybrid powertrains appeal (efficiency matters)
- Fleet sales can't all switch to SUVs
- Some buyers still prefer sedans
- International markets still buy sedans

---

### Will Sedans Ever Come Back?

**Factors That Could Revive Sedans:**

**1. Gas Prices**
If fuel prices spike significantly:
- SUV operating costs become painful
- Sedan efficiency advantage matters again
- Consumer preferences could shift

**2. Electric Vehicle Transition**
- EVs are often sedan-shaped (Model 3, Ioniq 6)
- Aerodynamics matter more for EV range
- Sedans more efficient than SUVs
- Could rebrand as "electric sedans" vs. traditional

**3. Urbanization**
- Cities favor smaller, efficient vehicles
- Parking challenges in urban areas
- Sedans easier to maneuver
- Younger urban buyers may prefer sedans

**4. Generational Shifts**
- Gen Z may reject SUV trend
- Environmental concerns favor efficiency
- Different status symbols than Boomers/Gen X

**But Realistically:**
Most experts believe sedan decline is permanent in North America. The shift to SUVs represents fundamental preference changes unlikely to reverse.

## Will Nissan Replace the Altima?

### No Direct Sedan Replacement Planned

**Nissan's Official Position:**
- No sedan replacement for the Altima
- Company shifting focus to crossovers and EVs
- Sentra remains (for now) as budget sedan option
- Rogue positioned as volume leader

**Product Strategy Going Forward:**

**Continued Models:**
- **Nissan Rogue:** Compact crossover, volume leader
- **Nissan Pathfinder:** 3-row family SUV
- **Nissan Armada:** Full-size body-on-frame SUV
- **Nissan Frontier:** Midsize pickup truck
- **Nissan Titan:** Full-size pickup (future uncertain)
- **Nissan Ariya:** Electric crossover
- **Nissan Z:** Sports car enthusiast model
- **Nissan Sentra:** Subcompact sedan (likely temporary)

**Discontinued/Uncertain:**
- Nissan Altima (2024)
- Nissan Maxima (2023)
- Nissan Sentra (rumored 2026 discontinuation)
- Nissan Leaf (being phased out for Ariya)

---

### The Electric Sedan Question

**Potential Future:**
Nissan may introduce an electric sedan, but unlikely to carry "Altima" nameplate.

**Why Electric Sedans Make Sense:**
- Aerodynamics improve EV range
- Lower center of gravity (battery placement)
- Tech-forward buyers prefer sedans
- Compete with Tesla Model 3, Hyundai Ioniq 6

**Potential Timeline:**
- **2026-2028:** Possible announcement
- **2028-2030:** Potential launch
- **New nameplate:** Likely not "Altima" (fresh start)

**Nissan's EV Plans:**
- Focus on Ariya crossover expansion
- Multiple EV models planned by 2030
- Electric sedan possible but not confirmed
- Priority: SUVs and crossovers in EV form


**Speculation:** Industry insiders suggest Nissan is developing a sedan-shaped EV for global markets, but North American introduction is uncertain. If it happens, expect 2028+ timeframe.

## Expert Opinions on Altima Discontinuation

### Automotive Journalists Weigh In

**Car and Driver:**
> *"The Altima's discontinuation is unfortunate but unsurprising. It was a competent, value-oriented sedan in a market that no longer values sedans. Nissan's CVT issues and fleet sales dependency sealed its fate. The real shame is that the 2019-2024 generation finally fixed many problems—just too late to matter."*

**MotorTrend:**
> *"The Altima served millions of Americans well for over 30 years. While it never achieved the prestige of an Accord or the reliability reputation of a Camry, it offered honest transportation at a fair price. In an era where that's increasingly rare, the Altima will be missed by those who valued substance over image."*

**Edmunds:**
> *"From a business perspective, Nissan's decision makes complete sense. The Altima simply couldn't generate the profits that SUVs do. The final-generation Altima was actually quite good—competitive with Accord and Camry in most ways. But 'quite good' isn't enough when the entire sedan segment is dying."*

**Jalopnik:**
> *"The Altima became a meme, and that probably didn't help. But underneath the jokes about aggressive Altima drivers was a genuinely practical car that did its job well. RIP to the V6 models especially—those were sleeper rockets that could embarrass far more expensive cars at stoplights."*

---

### Industry Analysts

**AutoForecast Solutions:**
> *"The Altima's discontinuation accelerates the sedan segment's decline. We project fewer than 1.2 million midsize sedans will be sold annually in the U.S. by 2026, down from 2.8 million in 2016. Even strong performers like Accord and Camry see declining volumes. The market has spoken: Americans want SUVs."*

**J.D. Power:**
> *"Altima owners reported above-average satisfaction with value and features, but below-average scores for transmission reliability and brand perception. These factors—combined with market trends—contributed to its inability to compete long-term. Interestingly, 2019+ owners report much higher satisfaction than 2013-2018 owners, suggesting Nissan did fix problems, just too late."*

**Cox Automotive:**
> *"The Altima's heavy fleet presence hurt retail perception and resale values. While fleet sales boosted volume numbers, they undermined brand value. This is a cautionary tale for automakers: short-term volume gains from fleet sales can have long-term brand consequences."*

### Negotiation Tips

**Best Practices for Buying Final-Year Altima:**

1. **Acknowledge the elephant:** "I know this is discontinued, so let's talk realistic pricing."
2. **Shop multiple dealers:** Get quotes from 3-5 dealerships
3. **Time your purchase:** December-January offers maximum leverage
4. **Bundle extended warranty:** Negotiate warranty into deal
5. **Focus on out-the-door price:** Ignore monthly payments initially
6. **Check inventory age:** Older inventory = more desperate dealer
7. **Be ready to walk:** Your leverage is strong

**Sample Negotiation:**
- MSRP: $28,840 (SV trim)
- Target price: $24,000-$25,000 (15-17% off)
- Extended warranty: Negotiate to $1,200-$1,500
- Total out-the-door: ~$27,000 including taxes/fees


**Insider Tip:** Dealers want to clear Altima inventory before 2025 models arrive. Visit the last week of December for maximum negotiating power. Many dealers will accept near-invoice pricing to hit year-end quotas.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When exactly will Altima production end?

Production is scheduled to end in **January-February 2025**. The final 2024 model year Altimas are currently being manufactured at Nissan's Smyrna, Tennessee plant. Dealer inventory should last through spring 2025.

### Will Nissan continue servicing my Altima after discontinuation?

**Yes, absolutely.** Nissan is legally required to provide parts and service for at least 10 years after discontinuation. All Nissan dealerships will continue to service Altimas with full factory support, technical training, and warranty coverage.

### Should I buy an extended warranty for a discontinued Altima?

**Strongly recommended**, especially for the CVT transmission. Extended warranties from Nissan or reputable third parties typically cost $1,500-$3,000, while CVT replacement can cost $4,000-$6,000. The math favors buying coverage, particularly for a discontinued model.

### Will my Altima suddenly be worth less?

Discontinuation causes an immediate **10-15% depreciation hit** beyond normal depreciation. However, if you plan to keep the car long-term (7+ years), this matters less. Trade-in values will be lower than Accord or Camry, but the upfront discount can offset this.

### What's the best model year to buy used?

**2019-2024 models** have the most reliable CVTs and modern features. **Avoid 2013-2016** due to widespread CVT issues. If buying older, **2007-2012 with traditional automatic transmission** (not CVT) are good bets, especially V6 models.

### Can I still get parts in 10-15 years?

**Common parts (brakes, filters, etc.):** Indefinitely available

**Mechanical parts (engine, transmission):** 15-20+ years typical

**Body panels and trim:** 10-15 years, then may become scarce

**Electronics:** 10-15 years, potentially longer

Nissan typically supports vehicles for 15-20 years with most parts. Critical items remain available even longer.

### What if I need warranty service after discontinuation?

Your warranty remains **fully valid** at all Nissan dealerships nationwide. Discontinuation doesn't affect warranty coverage, claims, or service. The 3-year/36,000-mile basic and 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranties are honored exactly as if the car were still in production.

### Is my current Altima suddenly unreliable because it's discontinued?

**No.** Discontinuation is a business decision, not a quality issue. Your Altima is exactly as reliable the day after the announcement as it was the day before. Continue normal maintenance and it will serve you just as long as any other sedan.

### Should I sell my Altima now or keep it?

**Depends on your situation:**

**Sell now if:**
- You planned to upgrade soon anyway
- Maximizing resale value is priority
- You want to avoid further depreciation
- You drive low miles (car worth more now)

**Keep it if:**
- Car is paid off or nearly paid off
- You planned to keep 5+ more years anyway
- Car is running well with low miles
- You don't want a car payment

**Don't panic sell.** Discontinuation doesn't make your car worthless or unreliable.

### What should I buy instead of an Altima?

**Best alternatives:**

- **Honda Accord** - Best overall sedan, strong reliability
- **Toyota Camry** - Maximum dependability and resale value
- **Mazda6** - Premium feel, excellent driving dynamics
- **Hyundai Sonata** - Great warranty, modern features
- **Nissan Rogue** - Stay with Nissan, get crossover utility

**Decision factors:** Budget, need for AWD, importance of resale value, typical ownership length.

## The Bottom Line

The Nissan Altima discontinuation represents more than just the end of one model—it symbolizes the American automotive market's dramatic transformation. For 31 years and 6.8 million sales, the Altima served as reliable, affordable transportation for families, students, and commuters across America.

### What We'll Remember

**The Altima's Legacy:**
- Proved Nissan could compete with Honda and Toyota
- Pioneered AWD in affordable midsize sedans
- Served millions with honest, practical transportation
- Represented attainable middle-class mobility
- Created lasting memories for multiple generations

**Lessons Learned:**
- Market forces trump product quality
- Fleet sales dependency creates long-term brand damage
- CVT reliability issues can destroy reputation
- Even good products can't survive macro trends
- SUV preference represents fundamental shift, not fad

**What's Lost:**
- A genuinely competitive midsize sedan
- Affordable AWD sedan option
- Entry point to Nissan brand
- Rental car ubiquity (for better or worse)
- Choice and diversity in sedan segment


**Final Thoughts:** The Altima didn't fail—it was a victim of circumstances beyond its control. The 2019-2024 generation was genuinely good, offering AWD, modern technology, and competitive pricing. But in today's market, being "good enough" isn't enough when consumers overwhelmingly prefer SUVs.

For those who bought Altimas over the years, the memories and miles traveled remain valuable. For those considering a final-year purchase, understand the trade-offs but know you're getting a competent sedan at unprecedented discounts.

The Altima served America well. Now it's time to say thank you and goodbye to a sedan that, while never the flashiest, was always there when you needed it.
