# When Did These 15 Iconic Brands Close? A Complete Timeline

Remember browsing KB Toys at the mall? Renting videos at Blockbuster? Shopping for gadgets at The Sharper Image? These beloved brands are gone, but when exactly did they close their doors?

If you've ever wondered "When did Toys R Us close?" or "What year did Borders shut down?" — you're not alone. Thousands of people search for these exact dates every month, settling debates and satisfying curiosity about when their favorite stores disappeared.

Here's a complete timeline of 15 iconic brand closures with exact dates, bankruptcy filings, and current status updates.

---

## 1. Toys R Us (US) - Closed June 2018

**Bankruptcy filed:** September 19, 2017  
**Liquidation announced:** March 15, 2018  
**Final US stores closed:** June 29, 2018  

The iconic toy retailer with 1,600+ US stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2017 after struggling with $5 billion in debt from a 2005 leveraged buyout. Initially attempting reorganization, the company announced full liquidation in March 2018 after a disastrous holiday season failed to generate needed cash flow.

The final US stores closed their doors on June 29, 2018, ending the era of the singing giraffe Geoffrey and the "I don't wanna grow up" jingle. Employees arrived to find stores padlocked with little warning. The closure eliminated 33,000 jobs and left a massive hole in the American toy retail landscape.

**Current status:** International stores remain open in Canada, Asia, and elsewhere. A small-scale US comeback was attempted in 2019-2021 with standalone stores and Macy's partnerships, but never regained traction. The brand still exists online and through licensing deals, but the iconic superstores are gone.

**Why it closed:** Crushing debt from the leveraged buyout left no room for necessary investments in e-commerce and store improvements. Amazon and Walmart captured toy sales while Toys R Us couldn't compete. The debt structure, not lack of customers, killed the chain.

## 2. Blockbuster - Closed 2014 (Corporate)

**Bankruptcy filed:** September 23, 2010  
**Peak closures:** 2010-2011  
**Corporate stores closed:** 2014  
**Last franchise:** Still open in Bend, Oregon  

Blockbuster's death was gradual and painful. At its peak in 2004, the company operated 9,000 stores worldwide. By 2010, Netflix and Redbox had devastated the video rental business model. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in September 2010, closing hundreds of stores immediately.

Corporate-owned stores completely closed by 2014 as the parent company (Dish Network, which bought Blockbuster in bankruptcy) pulled the plug. However, franchised locations operated independently, and one remains: the Bend, Oregon Blockbuster has become a profitable tourist attraction and legitimate local rental business, featured in documentaries and selling "Last Blockbuster" merchandise.

**Current status:** One franchise store survives in Bend, Oregon. It's profitable, popular, and exists as both functional video store and nostalgia museum. The rest is Netflix history—literally, as Blockbuster famously declined to buy Netflix for $50 million in 2000.

**Why it closed:** Failed to recognize the threat of streaming and mail-order rentals. By the time Blockbuster tried to compete with similar services, Netflix had insurmountable advantages. Late fees, the company's main profit driver, became its public relations nightmare.

## 3. Circuit City - Closed March 2009

**Bankruptcy filed:** November 10, 2008  
**Liquidation announced:** January 16, 2009  
**Final stores closed:** March 8, 2009  

The electronics retailer with 700+ stores filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy during the 2008 recession after years of declining sales and strategic missteps. The company initially hoped to reorganize but found no buyers willing to acquire the struggling chain during the economic crisis.

Liquidation was announced in January 2009, with going-out-of-business sales beginning immediately. The final stores closed on March 8, 2009, ending 60 years of operation. The closure eliminated roughly 30,000 jobs and left Best Buy as the dominant electronics specialty retailer.

**Current status:** The brand name was purchased and relaunched as an online-only retailer in 2016, bearing no relation to the original stores. It's essentially a zombie brand—the name continues, but everything else is gone.

**Why it closed:** Poor management decisions preceded the recession. Circuit City eliminated commissioned salespeople in 2003, gutting customer service. The company also pulled out of appliance sales, eliminating a profitable category. When the 2008 recession hit, Circuit City had no cushion to survive. Best Buy won the electronics retail war.

## 4. Borders Books - Closed September 2011

**Bankruptcy filed:** February 16, 2011  
**Liquidation announced:** July 18, 2011  
**Final stores closed:** September 2011  

The bookstore chain with 650+ stores filed for bankruptcy in February 2011 after years of losing ground to Amazon and Barnes & Noble. The company attempted to find a buyer, but the only serious bidder (private equity firm) withdrew its offer in July 2011, forcing liquidation.

Going-out-of-business sales began in July 2011, with emotional clearance events as book lovers said goodbye. The final stores closed in September 2011, ending 40 years of operation. The closure eliminated 11,000 jobs and left many communities without a major bookstore.

**Current status:** Completely gone. The brand name was sold in bankruptcy but never revived. Former Borders locations were converted to various retailers—Nordstrom Rack, Forever 21, and other chains occupy the spaces now.

**Why it closed:** Failed to invest in e-commerce and e-readers while Amazon dominated both. Borders famously outsourced its website to Amazon in 2001, essentially feeding customers to its competitor. By the time Borders tried to compete digitally, it was too late. The Kindle and iPad killed traditional bookstores, and Borders was least prepared.

## 5. RadioShack - Closed 2017 (Most Stores)

**First bankruptcy filed:** February 5, 2015  
**Second bankruptcy filed:** March 8, 2017  
**Peak closures:** 2015-2017  
**Current status:** ~400 franchise stores remain  

RadioShack's death was messy and confusing. The electronics retailer filed for bankruptcy in February 2015, closing roughly half its 4,000 stores. The remaining stores were acquired by hedge fund Standard General, which operated them for two years before filing bankruptcy again in March 2017.

In the second bankruptcy, most remaining corporate stores closed, though approximately 400 independently-owned franchise locations remain open today under different ownership. These surviving stores often share space with other businesses (like Sprint or Cricket Wireless) to reduce costs.

**Current status:** Confusing. About 400 franchise stores still operate, often as hybrid RadioShack/wireless stores. The brand also exists online. But the RadioShack you remember—with hobbyist parts, batteries, and confused employees—is essentially gone.

**Why it closed:** Failed to adapt to online retail and changing consumer needs. RadioShack couldn't decide whether to be a hobbyist parts store, a cell phone shop, or a consumer electronics retailer, succeeding at none. The rise of Amazon, Best Buy, and wireless carrier stores eliminated RadioShack's niches. Decades of management failure preceded the bankruptcies.

## 6. KB Toys - Closed February 2009

**First bankruptcy filed:** January 2004  
**Second bankruptcy filed:** December 11, 2008  
**Final stores closed:** February 2009  

KB Toys, the mall-based toy retailer with 460 stores, filed its second bankruptcy in December 2008 during the recession. The company had emerged from a 2004 bankruptcy but never regained stability. Liquidation sales began immediately, with stores closing throughout January and February 2009.

The final stores closed in February 2009, ending the era of small mall toy shops. KB Toys had been a fixture since 1922 (as Kaufman Brothers), but couldn't compete with Toys R Us superstores, Walmart's toy aisles, and online shopping.

**Current status:** Completely gone from physical retail. The brand was briefly revived as an online store and pop-up shops in 2018-2019 but failed again. The KB Toys name occasionally resurfaces but never sustainably.

**Why it closed:** Mall traffic declining, competition from big-box stores, and holiday-dependent business model. KB Toys generated most annual revenue in November-December, leaving the business vulnerable to any holiday season weakness. The 2008 recession delivered the final blow during the critical holiday period.

## 7. Tower Records - Closed December 2006 (US)

**First bankruptcy filed:** February 2004  
**Second bankruptcy filed:** August 20, 2006  
**Liquidation announced:** October 2006  
**Final US stores closed:** December 22, 2006  

The legendary music retailer filed for bankruptcy twice, ultimately liquidating in 2006 as digital music sales and iTunes devastated the CD business. Going-out-of-business sales began in October 2006, with the final US stores—including the iconic Sunset Boulevard location—closing December 22, 2006.

The closure ended 46 years of operation for a chain that had defined music retail culture. The yellow and red Tower Records logo had been synonymous with music discovery, midnight album releases, and record store culture.

**Current status:** Gone in the US, but Tower Records still operates in Japan and Ireland under separate ownership. The brand was sold internationally, and the Japanese operation is actually thriving. A 2015 documentary ("All Things Must Pass") chronicled Tower's rise and fall.

**Why it closed:** iTunes, Napster, and digital music destroyed the CD business. Tower Records carried massive debt and couldn't adapt quickly enough. By the time music sales shifted to digital and streaming, Tower Records was trapped with expensive leases, huge inventories of physical media, and no viable pivot strategy.

## 8. Sports Authority - Closed August 2016

**Bankruptcy filed:** March 2, 2016  
**Liquidation announced:** May 2016  
**Final stores closed:** August 2016  

The sporting goods retailer with 450+ stores filed for bankruptcy in March 2016, initially attempting to reorganize. However, within two months, the company announced full liquidation after failing to find buyers or secure necessary financing. Going-out-of-business sales began in May 2016, with final stores closing by August 2016.

The closure eliminated 14,500 jobs and left Dick's Sporting Goods as the dominant sports retailer, though the category as a whole was struggling against online competition and athleisure trend shifts.

**Current status:** Completely gone. The brand name was purchased but not revived for physical retail. Some intellectual property (house brand names) was sold to Dick's Sporting Goods.

**Why it closed:** High debt from a 2006 leveraged buyout left no financial flexibility. The company couldn't invest in e-commerce or compete with Dick's Sporting Goods, Amazon, and direct-to-consumer athletic brands. Private equity ownership extracted value but left Sports Authority vulnerable when retail conditions deteriorated.

---

## 9. CompUSA - Closed 2008

**Announced closure:** January 2007  
**Most stores closed:** 2007-2008  
**Final conversion to TigerDirect:** 2008  

CompUSA, the computer and electronics retailer with 230 stores at its peak, announced in January 2007 that it would close most locations. Over the following year, stores were either shut down or converted to TigerDirect retail locations (owned by the same parent company). By 2008, the CompUSA brand had effectively disappeared from physical retail.

**Current status:** The CompUSA name exists online only, operated by TigerDirect as an e-commerce site. No physical stores remain.

**Why it closed:** Failed to compete with Best Buy, online retailers, and direct-from-manufacturer sales. CompUSA's business model—selling computers and software in standalone stores—became obsolete as Dell pioneered direct sales and Amazon dominated online. The stores were expensive to operate with thin margins on increasingly commoditized products.

---

## 10. Linens 'n Things - Closed December 2008

**Bankruptcy filed:** May 2, 2008  
**Liquidation announced:** June 2008  
**Final stores closed:** December 2008 (some January 2009)  

The home goods retailer with 570 stores filed for bankruptcy in May 2008 during the early stages of the recession. Unable to find a buyer, the company announced liquidation in June 2008. Going-out-of-business sales ran through the fall, with final stores closing by December 2008 (a few stragglers lasted into January 2009).

The closure left Bed Bath & Beyond as the dominant specialty home goods retailer, though that company would later face its own struggles and bankruptcy in 2023.

**Current status:** The brand name was purchased and exists as an online-only retailer with no connection to the original stores.

**Why it closed:** Competition from Target, Walmart, and Bed Bath & Beyond eroded market share. The 2008 recession devastated home goods sales as housing market collapsed. Linens 'n Things carried significant debt and couldn't survive the sudden spending freeze. The company was essentially Bed Bath & Beyond's less successful competitor and lost that battle.

---

## 11. The Sharper Image - Closed June 2008

**Bankruptcy filed:** February 19, 2008  
**Liquidation announced:** April 2008  
**Final stores closed:** June 2008  

The upscale gadget retailer filed for bankruptcy in February 2008, initially attempting reorganization. However, by April 2008, the company announced liquidation after failing to find acceptable buyers. Going-out-of-business sales cleared inventory, with final stores closing by June 2008.

The Sharper Image had been a mall fixture since 1977, selling massage chairs, air purifiers, gadgets, and novelties. The brand represented aspirational consumer electronics before such products became mainstream and cheaper.

**Current status:** The brand name was sold and now appears on products in various retailers (Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's) but with no company connection to the original stores. It's a licensing brand only.

**Why it closed:** Products became commoditized as similar items appeared everywhere cheaper. The Sharper Image couldn't justify premium prices when Target sold comparable gadgets. A costly recall of the "Ionic Breeze" air purifier damaged reputation and finances. Mall traffic was declining, and the experiential store format couldn't compete with online shopping.

---

## 12. Mervyn's - Closed January 2009

**Bankruptcy filed:** July 29, 2008  
**Liquidation announced:** October 2008  
**Final stores closed:** January 2009  

Mervyn's, the California-based department store chain with 175 stores (mostly West Coast), filed for bankruptcy in July 2008 during the recession. After attempting to reorganize, the company announced liquidation in October 2008. Going-out-of-business sales ran through the holiday season, with final stores closing in January 2009.

The closure was particularly painful because Mervyn's had been a family-friendly middle-market department store that served communities lacking upscale alternatives. Many small California towns lost their only department store.

**Current status:** Completely gone. The brand has not been revived.

**Why it closed:** Private equity ownership in 2004 had separated the company from its valuable real estate, saddling Mervyn's with high rents on properties it once owned. This financial engineering left the company unable to survive the 2008 recession. Competition from Target, Kohl's, and discount retailers also eroded market share. The mid-tier department store segment was dying, and Mervyn's couldn't escape.

---

## 13. Service Merchandise - Closed 2002

**First bankruptcy filed:** 1999  
**Emerged from bankruptcy:** 2000  
**Second bankruptcy filed:** 2002  
**Final stores closed:** 2002  

Service Merchandise, the catalog showroom retailer, filed for bankruptcy in 1999, emerged briefly in 2000, then filed again in 2002, closing all remaining stores. The unique business model—browse a showroom of samples, order from a catalog, pick up from a warehouse—had become obsolete.

At its peak in the 1980s, Service Merchandise operated 400+ stores across the country, offering jewelry, electronics, housewares, and toys at discount prices through the catalog showroom model.

**Current status:** Completely gone. The company's liquidation was final, with no brand revival attempts.

**Why it closed:** The catalog showroom model became obsolete as big-box retailers like Walmart and Target offered similar prices with actual merchandise available immediately. The rise of online shopping eliminated the advantage of catalog browsing. Service Merchandise was caught between traditional retail and e-commerce with a format suited to neither.

---

## 14. Ames Department Stores - Closed December 2002

**Bankruptcy filed:** August 20, 2001  
**Liquidation announced:** 2002  
**Final stores closed:** December 2002  

Ames, the regional discount department store chain (Northeast and Mid-Atlantic), filed for bankruptcy in August 2001 after struggling with debt from a 1990s acquisition. The bankruptcy filing came just before 9/11, when economic conditions deteriorated further. Unable to reorganize successfully, Ames liquidated all 327 remaining stores by December 2002.

The closure eliminated 18,000 jobs and left many small towns without a department store, particularly in rural areas where Ames had been a retail anchor.

**Current status:** Completely gone, never revived.

**Why it closed:** Over-expansion through acquisitions (particularly the 1985 purchase of Zayre stores) left Ames with debt and operational challenges. The company never successfully integrated acquired stores or competed effectively against Walmart, Target, and Kmart. Poor management decisions, including a 1990 computer system disaster that destroyed inventory accuracy, preceded the final bankruptcy.

---

## 15. Woolworth (F.W. Woolworth) - Closed July 1997

**Closure announced:** May 13, 1997  
**Final stores closed:** July 17, 1997  

F.W. Woolworth, the iconic five-and-dime variety store chain founded in 1879, announced in May 1997 that it would close all 400 remaining "Woolworth" stores. The final stores closed on July 17, 1997, ending 118 years of American retail history.

Woolworth had been a cultural institution—the lunch counter civil rights sit-ins of 1960 occurred at Woolworth stores. The red storefront was a fixture on main streets across America for generations. But by the 1990s, the variety store format was hopelessly outdated.

**Current status:** The Woolworth store brand is completely gone. However, the parent company evolved into Foot Locker, Inc., which still operates today. Woolworth stores in other countries (UK, Germany, Australia) operated independently and some survived longer, though most eventually closed as well.

**Why it closed:** The five-and-dime variety store concept became obsolete as dollar stores, Walmart, and specialized retailers took over. Woolworth couldn't compete on price with Walmart or on selection with category specialists. The lunch counters and soda fountains that made Woolworth special became liabilities—expensive to operate with low margins. The parent company was more profitable operating Foot Locker and other specialty chains, so Woolworth stores were eliminated.

---

## Why Did So Many Stores Close in 2008–2009?

If you look at the timeline, there's an obvious cluster: **six major chains closed between 2008–2009**. This wasn't coincidence—it was the **Great Recession** devastating retail.

### The Perfect Storm

**Consumer spending collapsed.** When people lose jobs or fear losing jobs, discretionary purchases stop. Circuit City (electronics), KB Toys (toys), Linens 'n Things (home goods), and Mervyn's (clothing) all sold non-essential items that consumers eliminated first.

**Credit markets froze.** Retailers rely on credit lines to buy inventory and manage cash flow. When banks stopped lending in fall 2008, weak retailers couldn't finance operations. Circuit City and KB Toys filed bankruptcy partially because they couldn't access necessary credit.

**Commercial real estate values tanked.** Retail stores depend on valuable real estate. When property values collapsed, retailers couldn't sell buildings to raise cash or renegotiate favorable leases. Companies with heavy real estate debt (like Mervyn's, which had been separated from its properties by private equity) were trapped.

**Weak chains with debt couldn't survive.** Many failing retailers carried significant debt from leveraged buyouts or acquisitions. In good times, they could service this debt. In recession, debt payments consumed cash needed for operations. Circuit City, Sports Authority, Mervyn's, and Toys R Us all suffered from unsustainable debt loads that pre-dated the recession but became fatal during it.

### Online Shopping Accelerated

The recession also accelerated a shift already underway: **online shopping**. When money is tight, consumers become ruthless price-shoppers, and Amazon offered the best prices. Retailers that had delayed investing in e-commerce (Circuit City, Borders, CompUSA) found themselves completely unable to compete.

---

## The Second Wave: 2010s Closures

The brands that closed in the 2010s (Borders, Blockbuster, Sports Authority, RadioShack, Toys R Us) faced a different challenge: **digital disruption and the death of middle-market retail**.

**Digital killed categories:** Borders (books → Kindle/Amazon), Blockbuster (video rental → Netflix), Tower Records (CDs → iTunes/Spotify)

**Amazon killed pricing:** Sports Authority, RadioShack, and Toys R Us couldn't compete on price or convenience with Amazon Prime

**Mall traffic died:** RadioShack, KB Toys, and other mall-based retailers suffered as younger generations abandoned malls

**The middle disappeared:** Consumers split between luxury (willing to pay for experience) and value (lowest price). Middle-market retailers with nothing distinctive (Sports Authority, RadioShack) had no reason to exist.

---

## Why Do People Search for Closure Dates?

Thousands of people search "when did [store] close" every month. Why?

### Nostalgia Triggers Curiosity

When someone drives past a former Circuit City or remembers shopping at Borders, they wonder: "When did that actually end?" The memory is clear, but the exact timeline is fuzzy. People want to pin down when their nostalgia is from.

### Settling Debates

"I swear Toys R Us closed in 2017!" "No, it was 2018!" These debates happen frequently, especially online. This post settles them with exact dates. Similarly, people argue about whether Blockbuster closed in 2010 (most stores) or 2014 (corporate) or never (one franchise remains). Precision matters for trivia debates and internet arguments.

### Historical Context

Understanding when these brands closed helps contextualize economic history and personal memory. Knowing that Circuit City, KB Toys, Linens 'n Things, and others all closed within months of each other in 2008–2009 clarifies the recession's impact. Similarly, seeing how many bookstore/music store/video rental chains closed 2006–2011 illustrates the speed of digital disruption.

### Psychological Closure

There's something satisfying about knowing exact dates. It provides closure (pun intended) to wonder. "Borders closed September 2011" feels more final than "Borders closed around 2011." The precision marks the end definitively.

---

## What Happened to the Buildings?

Ever wonder what occupies the spaces where these stores once operated?

**Circuit City stores:** Many became Best Buy, Walmart, Target, or Hobby Lobby locations. The big-box format was easily repurposed.

**Borders stores:** Converted to Nordstrom Rack, DSW, Forever 21, HomeGoods, and other retailers. Prime real estate locations were quickly reoccupied.

**Toys R Us stores:** Some remain empty (the buildings are awkwardly large). Others became grocery stores, Halloween Spirit pop-ups, or were subdivided into multiple smaller retailers.

**RadioShack mall stores:** Small mall spaces were easily filled by phone accessory kiosks, vape shops, or expanded into neighboring stores.

**Blockbuster stores:** The standalone buildings became everything from taco restaurants to dental offices to gyms. The corner lot location made them valuable for service businesses.

---

## Are Any Comebacks Possible?

History shows retail comebacks are rare but possible:

**Successful revivals:**  
- **Surge soda** (Coca-Cola brought it back after social media campaigns)  
- **Clearly Canadian** (crowdfunded Kickstarter revival)

**Failed revivals:**  
- **Toys R Us** (attempted comeback 2019–2021 failed)  
- **KB Toys** (online revival 2018–2019 failed)  
- **Circuit City** (online-only brand has no connection to original)

**Zombie brands:**  
- **The Sharper Image**, **Linens 'n Things**, **CompUSA** exist as online-only brands or licensing deals with no connection to original stores

The pattern is clear: **Product brands** (Surge, Crystal Pepsi) can revive because nostalgia drives purchases. **Retail stores** can't revive because the business models that killed them (Amazon, online shopping, changing consumer behavior) haven't reversed.

Would you shop at a revived Borders if it opened? Probably not—you'd still buy from Amazon. The nostalgia is real, but the business case isn't.

---

## The Brands That Almost Made This List

**Sears:** Still technically exists with a handful of stores, so doesn't qualify as "closed"—yet.

**Kmart:** Also still technically exists with a couple stores, though effectively dead.

**Payless ShoeSource:** Closed 2019, attempted comeback 2020, effectively dead but complicated status.

**Gymboree:** Closed 2019, though the brand was revived online-only.

**Things Remembered:** Closed most stores 2019, exists online only.

**Bed Bath & Beyond:** Filed bankruptcy 2023, stores closed 2023—too recent for this list but will be included in future updates.

---

## Which Store Closure Surprised You Most?

Some closures shocked everyone (Toys R Us seemingly healthy before bankruptcy), others were expected (Blockbuster had been dying for years). Which brand closure affected you most?

**For many people:**
- **Toys R Us** hurt because kids loved it and parents thought it was financially stable
- **Borders** hurt book lovers who valued browsing physical books
- **Circuit City** shocked because Best Buy surviving suggested the category was viable
- **Blockbuster** was expected but still nostalgic—the death of movie rental culture
- **RadioShack** felt like losing a friend who'd been sick for years

Share your memories in the comments below. What do you remember about shopping at these stores? Were you at any going-out-of-business sales? Which closures still feel surreal?
