"What Really Happened to Pan Am? The Hijacking That Destroyed an Empire"
The Mystery Hook:

Pan Am was THE glamorous airline of the golden age
Then Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988
3 years later, Pan Am was dead

The Intrigue:

Lockerbie bombing killed 270 people
Lawsuits and security costs devastated Pan Am financially
But Pan Am was already struggling—the bombing was the final blow
Deregulation in 1978 destroyed their monopoly on international routes
They bought National Airlines in 1980 for $400M (terrible deal)
Tried to compete domestically against airlines built for that market

Mystery Elements:

The conspiracy theory: Some believe Pan Am was targeted specifically
The what-if: Would they have survived without Lockerbie?
The tragic irony: They pioneered international travel, then deregulation killed them

Reveal: Death by a thousand cuts (deregulation, bad acquisitions, rising costs), but Lockerbie was the bullet that ended it.
