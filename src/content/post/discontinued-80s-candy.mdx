# Discontinued 80s Candy Brands We Miss

The 1980s was a golden era for candy innovation. From neon-colored gumballs to chocolate bars with quirky fillings, candy manufacturers pushed the boundaries of sugar-fueled creativity. While some treats have stood the test of time, many beloved 80s candies have disappeared from store shelves, leaving only sweet memories behind.

Let's take a trip down memory lane and revisit the discontinued 80s candy brands that defined a generation—and left us craving more.


**Did You Know?** The average American consumed 25 pounds of candy per year in the 1980s, with candy bar sales reaching an all-time high mid-decade.

## 1. PB Max (1989-1994)




**What It Was:**  
PB Max was Mars Inc.'s ambitious attempt to create the ultimate peanut butter candy bar. It featured whole grain oats, peanut butter, and milk chocolate in a chewy, cookie-like base.

**Why We Miss It:**  
Despite strong sales and a loyal fanbase, Mars discontinued PB Max in 1994. The official reason? The company's executives simply didn't like peanut butter. Yes, really. This remains one of the most baffling discontinuations in candy history.


**The Legend:** Urban legend claims a Mars executive's peanut allergy led to PB Max's demise, though the company has never confirmed this.


**The Legacy:**  
Online petitions have circulated for decades begging Mars to bring it back, but to no avail. PB Max stands as a cautionary tale about letting personal preferences override market demand.

## 2. Bonkers! (1985-1996)

**What It Was:**  
Bonkers were chewy fruit candies with an intensely fruity filling that would "bonk you out" with flavor. The commercials featured giant fruits literally bonking people on the head—peak 80s advertising.

### Flavors We Loved:
- Grape
- Watermelon  
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Chocolate (yes, chocolate!)

**Why We Miss It:**  
Bonkers delivered an explosion of fruit flavor that modern fruit chews just can't match. The texture—soft and chewy with a liquid center—was unlike anything else on the market.

**Current Status:**  
Leaf Brands acquired the trademark and briefly brought back Bonkers in 2018, but they're hard to find and not quite the same as the original.


**Good News!** While hard to find, Bonkers are technically still in production. Check specialty candy retailers or Amazon for occasional stock.

## 3. Reggie! Bar (1978-1982)

**What It Was:**  
Named after baseball legend Reggie Jackson, this candy bar featured a round disc of peanuts and caramel covered in chocolate. It was essentially a flatter, wider version of a Baby Ruth.

**Why It Was Special:**  
During Reggie Jackson's first home game at Yankee Stadium after signing with the team, fans threw Reggie! bars onto the field in celebration. It became a cultural phenomenon beyond just candy.

**Why We Miss It:**  
The Reggie! bar represented the peak of celebrity-endorsed candies. While other athletes have lent their names to products, none captured the zeitgeist quite like Reggie's chocolate tribute.

**What Happened:**  
When Jackson's popularity waned, so did the candy bar. Standard Brands discontinued it in 1982, just four years after launch.

---

## 4. Marathon Bar (1973-1981)



**What It Was:**  
The Marathon Bar was an 8-inch braided caramel rope covered in chocolate. The packaging featured a ruler on the side so you could measure its impressive length.

**Why We Miss It:**  
In an era when candy bars were getting smaller, the Marathon Bar stood out (literally) as a generous treat. The braided texture made it fun to eat, and it lasted longer than traditional bars.


**Fun Fact:** The Marathon Bar is still available in the UK under the name "Curly Wurly," where it continues to be popular. American fans have been known to import them, though they're slightly smaller than the original.


---

## 5. Choco'lite (1960s-1993)

**What It Was:**  
Choco'lite was a chocolate bar with a wafer-thin, airy chocolate filling covered in more chocolate. It was marketed as a lighter alternative to traditional candy bars (hence the name).

**Why We Miss It:**  
Choco'lite had a unique melt-in-your-mouth texture that was both crispy and creamy. It felt indulgent without being too heavy—perfect for an after-school snack.

**What Happened:**  
Nabisco discontinued Choco'lite in 1993, likely due to increasing competition in the "light" candy category and changing consumer preferences.

---

## 6. Chocolate Babies (1900s-2011)

**What It Was:**  
These small, bite-sized chocolate candies shaped like babies had been around since the early 1900s, but they were especially popular in the 80s as penny candy.

**Why We Miss It:**  
At a penny each (or a nickel by the late 80s), Chocolate Babies were an affordable treat that kids could buy with their allowance. The chocolate was surprisingly good quality for such a cheap candy.

**Why They Disappeared:**  
Increasing concerns about the racial implications of the candy's appearance and name led to declining sales. Tootsie Roll Industries, which had acquired the brand, quietly discontinued them in 2011.

---

## 7. Oompas (1971-1983)

**What It Was:**  
Made by Willy Wonka Candy Company, Oompas were small, peanut butter and chocolate discs that came in a tube. Think of them as a proto-Reese's Pieces with a different texture.

**Why We Miss It:**  
Oompas had the perfect peanut butter to chocolate ratio, and the tube packaging made them easy to share (or not). The Wonka branding added an element of whimsy.

**What Happened:**  
Wonka discontinued Oompas in 1983 to focus on other products in their line. They were briefly revived in 2007 as "Tart N Tiny" but were nothing like the original.

---

## 8. Freshen-up Gum (1975-2019)

**What It Was:**  
Freshen-up was a revolutionary gum with a liquid gel center that burst in your mouth when you bit down. It came in flavors like spearmint, peppermint, cinnamon, and bubble gum.

**Why We Miss It:**  
The surprise liquid center made every piece of Freshen-up feel like an experience, not just gum. It was particularly popular with kids who loved the "trick" aspect of the exploding flavor.

**Current Status:**  
Cadbury Adams discontinued Freshen-up in 2019 after decades of production. While other liquid-center gums exist, none have captured the magic of the original.

---

## 9. Astro Pops (1963-2004, revived 2010)

**What It Was:**  
Astro Pops were rocket-shaped lollipops with layers of colorful, fruit-flavored hard candy. The pointed shape was designed to resemble a rocket ship, perfect for space-obsessed 80s kids.

**Why We Miss It:**  
Beyond the cool shape, Astro Pops had a unique three-flavor system where you could taste different flavors as you licked your way through the layers. The wax wrapper also doubled as a makeshift toy.


**Current Status:** After a complicated bankruptcy and trademark battle, Astro Pops returned in 2010 through Spangler Candy Company. However, many fans claim the formula has changed.


---

## 10. Certs (1956-2018)

**What It Was:**  
Certs were breath mints with a distinctive feature: Retsyn, a mysterious copper and partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil compound that gave them their unique flavor and slight green flecks.

**Why We Miss It:**  
Certs hit differently than other mints. The tagline "two mints in one" referred to their breath-freshening and candy-like qualities. They were stronger than Tic Tacs but not as aggressive as Altoids.

**What Happened:**  
Mondelēz International discontinued Certs in 2018 due to declining sales. The breath mint market had become oversaturated, and newer products offered more appealing flavors.

---

## 11. Garbage Can-dy (1980s)




**What It Was:**  
Capitalizing on the Garbage Pail Kids craze, Garbage Can-dy came in a small plastic trash can filled with sour powder candy. The package featured gross-out artwork similar to the trading cards.

**Why We Miss It:**  
Garbage Can-dy represented peak 80s grossness culture. Kids loved the shock value, and the sour powder itself was actually pretty good (basically, a proto-Warhead).

**What Happened:**  
When the Garbage Pail Kids fad died down in the late 80s, so did the candy. The brand has been revived multiple times, but never with the same cultural impact.

---

## 12. Seven-Up Bar (1951-1979)

**What It Was:**  
Despite the name, this candy bar had nothing to do with the soda. The Seven-Up Bar featured seven different sections, each with a different filling: chocolate, cherry, coconut, fudge, jelly, mint, and orange.

**Why We Miss It:**  
The Seven-Up Bar was like a variety pack in a single candy bar. You could eat one section at a time and enjoy different flavors, or bite into multiple sections for flavor combinations.

**What Happened:**  
The Trudeau Candy Company discontinued it in 1979 due to the complexity and cost of manufacturing a bar with seven different fillings. It was simply too expensive to produce profitably.

---

## Why Did These Candies Disappear?

Several factors contributed to the discontinuation of these beloved 80s treats:

### 1. Manufacturing Costs
Complex candies like the Seven-Up Bar and PB Max were expensive to produce. As profit margins tightened, companies eliminated products that required specialized equipment or processes.

### 2. Changing Consumer Preferences
The 80s favored bold, artificial flavors and experimental textures. By the 90s, consumers began preferring more "natural" options and simpler flavor profiles.

### 3. Corporate Consolidation
Many small candy companies were acquired by larger corporations in the 80s and 90s. New owners often discontinued legacy products to focus on flagship brands.

### 4. Shelf Space Competition
As retailers demanded slotting fees and limited shelf space, candy companies had to choose their most profitable products. Niche items were casualties of this consolidation.

### 5. Declining Sales
Some candies simply fell out of fashion. What seemed cool in the 80s felt dated by the 90s, and companies pulled the plug on underperforming products.


**Industry Insight:** Studies show that 80% of new candy products fail within their first year. Even successful candies can be discontinued if they don't meet profitability benchmarks.


---

## The Nostalgia Factor

Why do we remember these discontinued candies so fondly? Psychologists suggest several reasons:

**Childhood Memory Association:** We associate these candies with carefree childhood moments—after school, at the movies, or Halloween trick-or-treating.

**Scarcity Increases Value:** Once something is unavailable, we tend to romanticize it. The forbidden fruit effect makes discontinued candies seem better than they might have actually been.

**Sensory Memory:** Taste and smell are powerful triggers for memory. A similar candy can transport us back to specific moments in time.

**Shared Cultural Experience:** 80s kids collectively remember these candies, creating a sense of community around the nostalgia.

---

## Can We Get Them Back?

The internet has made it easier than ever for nostalgic consumers to voice their desires. Some discontinued candies have been revived through:

- **Online Petitions:** Change.org petitions for PB Max, Marathon Bars, and others have gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures
- **Limited Edition Re-releases:** Some companies have brought back discontinued items as special editions to test market demand
- **Small-Batch Producers:** Artisan candy makers sometimes recreate discontinued favorites in small batches
- **International Versions:** Some "discontinued" American candies are still available in other countries under different names

---

## Where to Find Discontinued Candy

While most of these treats are gone for good, dedicated candy hunters have a few options:

### Online Retailers
- **CandyFavorites.com:** Specializes in retro and hard-to-find candies
- **OldTimeCandy.com:** Carries vintage candy and classic treats
- **Amazon:** Occasionally has old stock or international versions

### Specialty Stores
Some regional candy stores stock discontinued items or close approximations.

### International Imports
UK and Canadian versions of American candy sometimes include flavors or products discontinued in the US.

### Candy Conventions
Events like the Sweets & Snacks Expo sometimes feature vintage candy vendors.

---

## Modern Alternatives

While nothing quite replaces these discontinued favorites, some modern candies capture similar flavor profiles:

| Discontinued Candy | Modern Alternative |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| PB Max | Reese's Fast Break or Nutrageous |
| Marathon Bar | Curly Wurly (UK import) |
| Bonkers | Hi-Chew for intense fruit flavor |
| Freshen-up Gum | Extra Dessert Delights |
| Oompas | Reese's Pieces |

---

## The Bottom Line

Discontinued 80s candy represents more than just sugar and chocolate—these treats are time capsules of a specific era in American culture. They remind us of simpler times, Saturday morning cartoons, and the joy of choosing candy at the corner store with quarters jingling in our pockets.

While most of these candies are gone forever, their legacy lives on in our memories and in the occasional social media thread where fellow 80s kids bond over shared candy experiences.
