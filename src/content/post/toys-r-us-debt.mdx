"What Really Happened to Toys R Us? The Billions in Debt That Killed Childhood"
The Mystery Hook:

Toys R Us was PROFITABLE when they filed for bankruptcy
They weren't losing money—so why did they die?

The Intrigue:

Private equity firms (KKR, Bain Capital, Vornado) bought TRU in 2005 for $6.6 billion
Loaded the company with $5.3 billion in DEBT
Toys R Us had to pay $400 MILLION annually just in interest
Meanwhile, Amazon was eating their lunch AND they couldn't invest in e-commerce because all profits went to debt

Mystery Elements:

The villain: Private equity vultures who extracted value while killing the company
The victim: 33,000 employees laid off with zero severance initially
The conspiracy: Did PE firms deliberately bankrupt them to extract real estate value?

Reveal: This wasn't a business failure—it was financial engineering that killed an iconic brand. "Murdered by private equity."
