  "overview_md": "**Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)** was a U.S. commercial bank founded in 1983 that specialized in serving venture-backed startups, growth-stage tech and life-sciences firms, and the venture capital ecosystem. It offered operating accounts, venture debt, treasury services, and private banking to founders and funds, positioning itself as the go-to banking partner for innovation businesses.\n\nAs low-rate years swelled deposits and client cash balances, SVB invested heavily in longer-duration securities. When interest rates rose sharply and tech funding slowed, unrealized losses on those securities combined with concentrated, networked depositors to create vulnerability. In **March 2023**, after announcing a securities sale and planned capital raise, the bank experienced a rapid run on deposits.\n\nOn **March 10, 2023**, California regulators closed SVB and appointed the **FDIC** as receiver. A bridge bank continued critical services while authorities moved to protect depositors and stabilize the system. Later in March, **First Citizens Bank** agreed to acquire substantially all deposits and loans from the receiver. SVB’s collapse became a defining event of the **2023 banking turmoil**, prompting sector-wide reviews of interest-rate risk management, liquidity buffers, and supervision for institutions with concentrated client bases.",
