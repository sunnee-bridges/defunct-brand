  "summary": "The **Yamaha RX100** was a nimble, air-cooled 98cc two-stroke sold in India from the mid-1980s to 1996 (via Escorts Yamaha). Loved less for its looks than for the sheer fun per kilogram, it delivered quick throttle response, a lively exhaust note, and surprising real-world pace. Period tests and enthusiast reports often cite ~14–15 seconds for a standing quarter mile—remarkable for a 100cc commuter of its era. Though discontinued in 1996, the RX100’s light weight, punchy mid-range, and simplicity turned it into a long-lived enthusiast favorite.",

  "overview_md": "Launched in India in the **mid-1980s** through **Escorts Yamaha**, the **RX100** distilled motorcycling to the essentials: a responsive **98cc two-stroke**, a slick 4-speed box, and a kerb weight light enough to make every ride feel eager. Owners prized the bike’s crisp throttle, tractable low-end pull, and the way it hustled through traffic. \n\nOn paper it was modest, but in practice it felt quick—contemporary road tests and rider lore frequently cite **~14–15s quarter-mile runs**, a figure that speaks more to the RX100’s excellent **power-to-weight** than outright horsepower. Maintenance was straightforward, parts were plentiful, and the exhaust note became part of its identity. \n\nBy the **mid-1990s**, tighter **emission norms** and a market pivot toward **4-stroke** efficiency ended RX100 production (**1996**). Successors like the RXG/RX135 tried to carry the torch, but the original’s recipe—light, lively, and simple—cemented the RX100’s status as a cultural touchstone. Today it survives in restorations, classifieds, and weekend rides, celebrated as the bike that proved ‘fun’ isn’t about engine size.",
