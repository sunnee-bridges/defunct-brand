  "hook": "Featherweight Indian 2-stroke that punched far above its 100cc displacement—a cult icon that proved performance isn't about horsepower alone.",
  "fate": "Production ended in 1996 as India's tightening emissions regulations and industry shift toward cleaner 4-stroke engines made the RX100 obsolete. Yet the bike endured in the aftermarket and collector scene, celebrated as a modern classic. In 2024, Yamaha revived the RX100 nameplate as a modern reinterpretation—a contemporary 4-stroke engine with modern safety and emissions compliance. While it carries the legendary name, the new RX100 is fundamentally different from the original 1985–1996 two-stroke, proving that some icons inspire rather than replicate.",
  "summary": "The **Yamaha RX100** was a nimble, air-cooled **98cc two-stroke** that ruled Indian roads from **1985 to 1996** via Escorts Yamaha. Deceptively simple—responsive 4-speed gearbox, lightweight frame, spark-plug-simple engineering—it delivered the kind of visceral riding experience that horsepower charts couldn't capture. Contemporary road tests and enthusiast accounts consistently cite **~14–15 second quarter-mile runs**, a figure that exemplified the RX100's exceptional **power-to-weight ratio** and made it legendary among commuters and weekend riders alike. The bike's lively 2-stroke exhaust note became part of its identity, a mechanical soundtrack that announced 'fun' before you even twisted the throttle. By **1996**, tightening **emission standards** and the industry's pivot toward **4-stroke efficiency** ended RX100 production in India. Yet the RX100 never truly disappeared—it became the motorcycle that proved motorcycling joy isn't measured in cubic centimeters. Today, decades later, the RX100 survives in restoration scenes, enthusiast forums, and weekend rides across India and beyond, celebrated as the bike that captured an era when simplicity, reliability, and pure performance synergy defined the two-wheeler experience.",

  "overview_md": "Launched in India in **1985** through **Escorts Yamaha**, the **RX100** distilled motorcycling philosophy to pure essentials: a **responsive 98cc two-stroke engine**, a slick **4-speed transmission**, and a **featherweight chassis** that made every ride feel eager and alive. Owners didn't love the RX100 for styling or luxury features—they revered it for what it *did*: how it flickered through traffic, the way the engine came alive in the midrange, and the mechanical symphony of a properly-tuned 2-stroke at full song.\n\nOn paper it was modest: ~11 horsepower, ~100 kilograms, no frills. But in practice, the RX100 felt like a **performance machine**. Contemporary road tests and rider testimony—still vibrant in forums and classifieds—frequently cite **~14–15 second quarter-mile times**, a benchmark that reveals the RX100's genius: exceptional **power-to-weight synergy**. That 11 horsepower spread across 100 kilograms meant the bike accelerated with a snappiness that 200cc scooters couldn't match. The crisp throttle response, tractable low-end pull, and high-rpm scream of the 2-stroke exhaust became legendary.\n\nMaintenance was refreshingly simple: spark plugs, air filter, chain lube. Parts were plentiful and cheap. The RX100 became the bike you could actually *live with*—commute on Monday, thrash on Saturday, and have enough coin left for petrol.\n\nBy the **mid-1990s**, India's tightening **emission regulations** and the global industry's shift toward **4-stroke efficiency** spelled the end. The RX100 was finally discontinued in **1996**, unable to meet new emissions standards without losing its essential character. Successors like the **RXG** and **RX135** tried to capture the magic but diluted the recipe—heavier, more complex, less special.\n\nToday, the **RX100 is a modern classic**. Used examples of the original command surprising prices, restoration scenes thrive, and forums overflow with owner diaries and technical discussions. The original bike survives in weekend runs, amateur racing, and collector garages—a testament to simplicity, reliability, and the radical idea that fun doesn't require complexity.\n\nIn **2024**, Yamaha revived the **RX100 nameplate** as a contemporary reinterpretation: a modern **4-stroke engine** with updated emissions compliance, modern safety features, and contemporary styling. While it honors the original's legend, the new RX100 is fundamentally different—more practical, efficient, and compliant, but lacking the raw simplicity that made the original iconic. The original RX100 proved that performance is about engineering efficiency, not displacement. The revival proves that some names transcend their machines—they become symbols of an era, of simplicity, of the pure joy of riding. For purists, the original 1985–1996 RX100 remains irreplaceable; for new riders, the modern version offers a fresh entry point to the legend.",
