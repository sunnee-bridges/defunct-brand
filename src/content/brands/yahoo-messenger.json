  "overview_md": "**Yahoo! Messenger** was one of the defining instant messengers of the early web. Debuting in **1998** as **Yahoo! Pager**, it quickly evolved into a full chat platform with persistent contact lists, rich emoticons, status messages, and playful features like *Buzz* that nudged a conversation window. As broadband arrived, Messenger layered in **webcam** support, **voice calls**, and file/photo sharing, becoming a daily communication tool for students, families, and small businesses worldwide.\n\nThrough the 2000s it competed with AIM, MSN/Windows Live Messenger, and ICQ, often leading in certain regions thanks to Yahoo’s portal reach (Mail, Groups, Finance) and easy identity management. Mobile and social shifts eventually rewired chat usage toward **SMS**, **WhatsApp**, **Facebook Messenger**, and later unified platforms embedded in phones. Yahoo attempted a reboot with a modern Messenger in **2015** and retired the legacy client in **2016**, but usage continued to decline.\n\nOn **July 17, 2018**, Yahoo discontinued Messenger, pointing users to export their chat history and test experimental group chat apps that followed. The brand’s imprint—screen names, away messages, webcam chat rooms, and animated emoticons—remains part of internet culture, marking a transition from desktop-era portals to today’s mobile-first messaging.",
