  "overview_md": "**Yahoo! Messenger** (originally **Yahoo! Pager**) was a fixture of late-1990s and 2000s online life—free IM with presence (away/idle), custom statuses, webcam chat, file transfer, group rooms, and playful features like **Audibles** and the window-shaking **Buzz**. It added mobile tie-ins and even a period of **interoperability with MSN/Windows Live Messenger** before the walled-garden era returned. As social networks, smartphones, and encrypted chat apps took over, usage fell. Yahoo discontinued the service in **2018** after attempting modern rewrites.",
