  "overview_md": "**Brach’s Maple Nut Goodies** were a long-running staple of the brand’s peg-bag line—**roasted peanuts** in a **chewy maple toffee** with a thin candy shell. Fans remember the maple aroma and soft-chewy center. In the late 2010s a manufacturing change reportedly made pieces noticeably **harder**, drawing complaints. Distribution shrank through the early 2020s, and by ~2022 Ferrara had **discontinued** the product, with no formal relaunch announced as of 2025.\n\nCollectors still trade vintage bags and look for substitutes (e.g., maple-coated peanuts), but the particular chewy-maple profile of Maple Nut Goodies hasn’t been replicated by major brands.",
