  "overview_md": "**Tuesday Morning** was a U.S. off-price retailer specializing in brand-name closeouts for the home—tabletop, linens, rugs, seasonal décor, and kitchenware. Founded in 1974 in Dallas, the chain grew through a no-frills model: modest stores, opportunistic buying, and limited advertising, relying on treasure-hunt merchandising and mailed circulars to drive trips. Locations were common in neighborhood centers rather than enclosed malls, and assortments turned quickly with liquidation lots and vendor overstock.\n\nAs e-commerce reshaped value shopping and supply chains tightened, the closeout pipeline became less predictable while store traffic fragmented. The company entered **Chapter 11 in May 2020**, shuttering underperforming stores during the pandemic and working down lease liabilities before emerging later that year into early 2021. **In February 2023**, Tuesday Morning again sought bankruptcy protection amid liquidity pressure, freight and occupancy costs, and recovery lag in discretionary categories.\n\nCourt filings in spring **2023** led to a wind-down and **liquidation of remaining U.S. stores**, with merchandise sold through going-out-of-business events. The brand’s decline reflected broader pressures on mid-scale specialty chains caught between faster off-price giants and online marketplaces—where closeout goods increasingly reach consumers without a dedicated brick-and-mortar stop.",
