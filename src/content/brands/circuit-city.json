  "overview_md": "**Circuit City** grew from a small Richmond, Virginia shop (founded **1949**) into one of America’s best-known **big-box electronics** chains. By the 1980s–1990s, its red-trimmed **superstores** and circular drive-thru pickup lanes were weekend staples for TVs, VCRs, car audio, and PCs. The company experimented with service offerings (eventually branded **Firedog**) and benefited from the home-theater boom, yet retail dynamics shifted: **Best Buy’s** low-pressure showrooming, Walmart’s pricing power, and e-commerce eroded Circuit City’s advantages.\n\nStrategic missteps compounded the pressure. Store relocations left gaps in prime trade areas; appliance exits reduced traffic; and in **2007** the chain **laid off ~3,400 experienced sales associates** to cut costs—saving payroll, but hurting service and conversion. The 2008 financial crisis crushed discretionary electronics demand and tightened vendor credit. Circuit City **filed Chapter 11 in November 2008**; efforts to reorganize or find a buyer fell short. In **January 2009** the company moved to liquidate, and by **March 2009** the last stores closed.\n\nThe **Circuit City** name later reappeared online under different ownership, a reminder of the brand’s recognition even after its brick-and-mortar exit. Its rise and fall trace the arc of U.S. electronics retail—from commission sales floors and Sunday inserts to price transparency, omnichannel logistics, and relentless competition on convenience.",
