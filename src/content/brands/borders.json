  "overview_md": "**Borders** grew from a **1971** Ann Arbor bookstore into a national chain that helped define the **big-box bookstore** era—cafés, events, and deep backlist under one roof. The company expanded rapidly through the 1990s after **Kmart acquired Borders and merged it with Waldenbooks**, then spun it out as **Borders Group**. Superstores flourished alongside music and DVD sales, while knowledgeable staff and author appearances built local followings.\n\nBut the industry shifted. Borders **outsourced its early online store to Amazon (2001–2008)**, ceding hard-won customer relationships at the dawn of e-commerce. Digital reading rose quickly, yet Borders’ own e-book strategy and device partnerships arrived late, while long leases and big footprints limited flexibility. As music/DVD categories declined and price transparency spread, comparable sales weakened and vendor terms tightened.\n\nBorders filed **Chapter 11 in 2011**, closing hundreds of locations; efforts to reorganize or find a buyer fell short, leading to **liquidation** and the final closure of U.S. stores later that year. The brand’s fall marked a turning point in book retail: smaller independents reemerged with curated models, while surviving chains leaned into omnichannel, membership perks, and experiences. For many readers, Borders remains a memory of sprawling stacks, café tables, and discovering a new author on a rainy afternoon.",
