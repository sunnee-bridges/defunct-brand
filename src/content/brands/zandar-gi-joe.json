  "summary": "Introduced in **1986** for *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero*, **Zandar** (Zartan's brother and a **Dreadnok**) featured **UV-reactive plastic** so that exposed 'skin' **shifted to a bluish tone in sunlight**—a signature innovation that completed the legendary color-change trio with Zartan and Zarana. This wasn't just visual; kids could test it instantly on the playground, making Zandar an unforgettable part of 80s toy culture. Packed with covert-ops gear befitting his swamp-raider Dreadnok aesthetic, he reinforced the clan's infiltrator identity. By the **1990s**, the UV color-change feature was phased out as manufacturing standards and durability concerns shifted focus, but Zandar remained in Hasbro's lineup through the **2000s and beyond**. Modern versions emphasize sculpt and articulation, yet the original 1986 release remains iconic—a testament to 80s toy innovation when such features defined a figure's legacy.",

  "overview_md": "**Zandar** joined the 3.75\" *G.I. Joe* roster in **1986** as a **Dreadnok** and brother to Zartan, featuring one of the era's most innovative toy effects: **UV-reactive plastic**. In **sunlight**, his exposed 'skin' **turned to a striking bluish tone**—a feature kids could demo instantly on any playground, making him unforgettable. He arrived with covert-ops style accessories (bandanna/scarf, backpack, weapons) and a grim camo color palette that screamed swamp-raider Dreadnok attitude, completing the legendary color-change trio (Zartan, Zarana, Zandar) that dominated playground conversations in the mid-80s.\n\nThroughout the **late 1980s and early 1990s**, this color-change trio became legendary among collectors and kids alike. However, by the **1990s**, the **UV color-change feature was phased out** as manufacturing standards evolved and durability concerns emerged. The photochromic plastic that once made Zandar special couldn't withstand the rigors of play and storage.\n\nToday, in the **2000s and beyond**, Hasbro has refreshed Zandar across various scales and articulation systems, but the focus shifted to improved sculpts, articulation, and accessories rather than color-change effects. Yet **Zandar v1 (1986)** remains iconic—a time capsule of 80s toy innovation when a single feature could define a character's legacy. Collectors prize the original precisely because that UV effect is what made him part of a revolutionary toy moment and, ultimately, what makes him rare.",
