  "summary": "Introduced in **1986** for *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero*, **Zandar** (Zartan’s brother, a Dreadnok) used UV-reactive plastic so exposed ‘skin’ shifted to a **bluish tone in sunlight**. Packed with disguise-themed gear, he complemented Zartan and Zarana in the color-change trio. Later Zandar figures usually kept the character but **omitted** the UV gimmick.",

  "overview_md": "**Zandar** joined the 3.75\" *G.I. Joe* roster in **1986** as a **Dreadnok** and brother to Zartan. Like his siblings, the original figure employed **UV-reactive plastic** so that in **sunlight** his exposed ‘skin’ **turned bluish**, selling the ‘chameleon/disguise’ fantasy on the playground. He arrived with covert-ops style accessories (bandanna/scarf, backpack, weapons) and a grim camo color palette that tied him to the swamp-raider aesthetic.\n\nAcross the late 80s and 90s, Hasbro refreshed the character and team, but the **sunlight color-change** was **phased out** as materials and play features evolved. Modern Zandar figures emphasize sculpt, articulation, and gear rather than photochromic tricks, leaving the **1986 version** iconic for its UV effect alongside **Zartan** and **Zarana**.",
