  "overview_md": "AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) was one of the defining chat clients of the dial-up and early broadband era. Launched in 1997, it popularized the Buddy List, distinctive screen names, and away messages. AIM supported 1:1 and group chat and helped normalize real-time presence online. o stay competitive against other mobile messengers and social networking applications, AOL released AIM Triton in 2005. The service offered IM, e-mail, SMS messaging, and voice and video chat. However, AIM struggled to find its place with its single focus on messaging, which fell out of favor against newer options. Social networks like Facebook, as well as a shift to mobile-friendly applications, made AIM seem dated and obsolete. As competitors rose, AIM's usage fell, and AOL announced the end of service in October 2017, officially shutting down the service on December 15, 2017.",
