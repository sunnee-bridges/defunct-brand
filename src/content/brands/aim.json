  "overview_md": "**AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)** was one of the defining chat clients of the dial-up and early broadband era. Launched in **1997**, it popularized the **Buddy List**, distinctive **screen names**, and the culture of **away messages**. AIM supported 1:1 and group chat and helped normalize real-time presence online. As mobile-first messengers and social apps rose, AIM’s usage fell, and AOL announced the end of the service in **October 2017**, shutting it down on **December 15, 2017**.",
