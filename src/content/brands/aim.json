  "overview_md": "**AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)** was one of the defining chat clients of the dial-up and early broadband era. Launched in **1997**, it popularized the **Buddy List**, distinctive **screen names**, and the culture of **away messages**—tiny personal status notes that doubled as micro-blogs. AIM supported one-to-one and group chats, file transfers, and “Direct Connect,” and it colocated a huge youth and college audience in shared **chat rooms**. For many U.S. users, hearing the “door open” sound meant friends were online.\n\nAIM rode AOL’s brand and distribution to dominance in the early 2000s, and its private **OSCAR** protocol (and developer-friendly **TOC** gateway) made it a hub for third-party clients. But the landscape shifted: **SMS**, social networks, and later mobile-first apps (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger) pulled conversations away; multi-protocol desktops (Trillian, Pidgin) commoditized the client; and the move from PCs to smartphones weakened AOL’s installed base. Attempts to modernize—new UIs, social feeds, and a 2012 relaunch—couldn’t reverse the trend.\n\nIn **October 2017** AOL announced AIM’s end, and the service shut down on **December 15, 2017**. AIM’s legacy lives on in the language of status, presence, and group chat that modern messengers—and corporate chat tools—still use today.",
