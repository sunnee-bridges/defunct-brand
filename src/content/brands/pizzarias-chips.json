"overview_md": "**Pizzarias** were pizza-flavored tortilla chips produced by Keebler from 1991 to 2002 that actually tasted like pizza. With aggressive seasoning, triangular shapes, and varieties like Supreme and Zesty Pepperoni, Pizzarias became a cult favorite among 90s kids before vanishing in the early 2000s.\n\nLaunched in **1991** during the golden age of extreme snack flavors, Pizzarias delivered on their promise: chips that genuinely tasted like pizza. The triangular tortilla chips were covered in reddish-orange seasoning that included tomato powder, cheese, garlic, and oregano. The coating left telltale powder on your fingers—a badge of honor for any kid eating them.\n\n**Pizzarias Supreme** featured flavors meant to evoke supreme pizza with pepperoni, sausage, peppers, and cheese. **Pizzarias Zesty Pepperoni** focused on spicier pepperoni pizza flavor. Both had devoted followings, with playground debates over which was superior.\n\nThe chips were perfect **after-school snacks** and lunchbox staples. Kids loved the intense pizza flavor and novelty factor. The chips satisfied pizza cravings without requiring actual pizza—you could have \"pizza\" anywhere, anytime. They became trading currency on school playgrounds.\n\nKeebler marketed them heavily with TV commercials emphasizing \"real pizza taste.\" The bright red and yellow packaging with pizza imagery screamed 90s snack marketing. Pizzarias stood out among more conservative chip offerings.\n\nBy the late 1990s, snack trends were shifting. Health-conscious parents moved away from aggressively flavored chips. The extreme snack era that birthed Pizzarias was fading. When **Kellogg's acquired Keebler in 2001**, corporate restructuring likely sealed Pizzarias' fate.\n\nPizzarias were **quietly discontinued around 2002** with no official announcement. The chips simply stopped appearing in stores. By 2003, they had vanished completely.\n\nAs **90s nostalgia** intensified, fans began searching desperately for Pizzarias. Online forums filled with questions: \"What happened to Pizzarias?\" Change.org petitions requesting their return accumulated thousands of signatures. Facebook groups and Twitter campaigns periodically trend among snack enthusiasts.\n\nVarious competitors tried filling the void. Doritos released pizza-flavored limited editions, but fans insist nothing matches the original Pizzarias formula. The specific seasoning blend has never been successfully replicated.\n\nFor **90s kids now in their 30s and 40s**, Pizzarias represent peak childhood snacking—the chips you begged parents to buy, the snack you'd trade half your lunch for. The memory of that distinctive pizza seasoning remains vivid decades later, a sense memory that no current snack quite triggers.\n\nToday, Pizzarias exist only in nostalgia. Original bags occasionally appear on eBay as collectibles. Despite persistent fan requests and demonstrated demand, Keebler has shown no interest in revival. The demand is real, but apparently not sufficient to justify bringing them back.\n\nPizzarias weren't just snacks—they were part of 90s childhood, intertwined with after-school TV, playground trades, and simpler times. Wanting them back means wanting to return to that era, and since time travel isn't possible, the chips remain a pizza-flavored ghost of snacks past.",
