  "overview_md": "**Lawn Darts (Jarts)** were a popular backyard game consisting of large dart-like projectiles with weighted metal tips that players would throw at ground targets...\n\n**The Ban:** In 1988, the CPSC issued a federal ban on lawn darts with elongated tips. The specific prohibition covers any lawn dart with a rigid, weighted tip—whether metal or other hard materials. Modern 'lawn darts' with soft, rounded plastic tips are technically legal but are fundamentally different products that don't carry the same risk profile.\n\n**Legal Status Today:** It remains illegal to sell, manufacture, or import the original-style weighted lawn darts in the United States. Penalties can reach $15,000 for violations."
