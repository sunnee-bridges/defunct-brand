  "overview_md": "**Hubba Bubba Bubble Jug** turned gum into a novelty ritual. Sold in a pocket-size plastic “jug,” the product contained sweet, flavored powder and tiny crystals that behaved like candy at first bite, then cohered into bubble gum as you chewed. Marketed under Wrigley’s Hubba Bubba brand, Bubble Jug arrived in the early 1990s and quickly found a niche alongside other playground favorites like Bubble Tape. Flavors centered on classic fruit (and occasional sour or tropical variants), and ads leaned on the pour-and-chew gimmick to stand out in crowded checkout aisles.\n\nThe format invited collecting (different colors/labels) and sharing—kids would “dose out” a friend a capful. That same quirk limited its everyday appeal as tastes shifted toward long-lasting sticks, pellets, and sugar-free lines. Through the 2000s, availability became patchier, with short revivals and packaging refreshes at mass retailers. By the early 2010s, Bubble Jug largely disappeared from U.S. shelves, persisting mainly in nostalgia posts, vintage commercials on YouTube, and the occasional international sighting or novelty import.\n\nToday it’s remembered as a quintessential **vanished product**: more about the **experience** than the flavor—unscrew, pour, chew, and marvel as powder somehow became bubble gum.",
