  "overview_md": "**Sears (Canada)** began in 1952 as a joint venture between Simpsons and Sears, Roebuck, blending U.S.-style catalog scale with Canadian merchandising know-how. Through the 1950s–1970s it became a household name: the thick catalog on kitchen tables, auto centers in suburban plazas, and anchor stores in new shopping malls from coast to coast. Its mix of trusted private labels (including licensed **Kenmore**) and broad “one-stop” assortments made Sears a default destination for appliances, tools, fashions, and home goods.\n\nBy the 2000s, however, the formula that once guaranteed traffic started to fray. Malls matured, e-commerce accelerated, and category killers chipped away at high-margin lines such as appliances and electronics. Cost controls and property monetization bought time but dulled the in-store experience. Attempts to modernize—store remodels, edited assortments, and a smaller catalog footprint—couldn’t overcome falling sales and rising obligations. In **2017** the company sought court protection and, after failed bids to reorganize, moved to an orderly wind-down. The final stores closed in **2018**, ending more than six decades of Canadian retail history.\n\nFor many Canadians, Sears was more than a store; it was where families ordered bunk beds, winter boots, or their first washer-dryer set. The brand’s disappearance marked the close of a catalog-to-mall era and a reminder of how quickly retail habits can shift.",
