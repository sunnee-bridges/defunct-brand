  "summary": "Founded by Charles Lazarus, Toys “R” Us grew from a post-war children’s furniture shop (1948) into the world’s best-known toy superstore chain. Following years of debt from a 2005 LBO and mounting competition from e-commerce and big-box retailers, the company filed for Chapter 11 in 2017 and liquidated its U.S. stores in 2018. The brand name lived on under new owners (Tru Kids, later with WHP Global), including online sales and shop-in-shop locations at Macy’s.",

  "overview_md": "**Toys “R” Us** became synonymous with toy shopping in the U.S. and abroad. The chain popularized the big-box toy superstore model, expanded internationally, and spun up **Babies “R” Us** for infant goods.\n\nHeavy debt from a **2005 leveraged buyout** and a rapid shift toward **e-commerce** and **discounters** eroded performance. The company filed for **Chapter 11 in 2017** and, unable to find a buyer for the entire U.S. business, **liquidated in 2018**, shuttering hundreds of stores. The **intellectual property** was later acquired by **Tru Kids** (and subsequently tied to **WHP Global**), which experimented with small experiential stores, online sales, and **Macy’s** shop-in-shops.\n\nWhile the original U.S. company ended in 2018, the **brand** persists in limited forms—an example of a famous retail name outliving the corporation that made it ubiquitous.",
