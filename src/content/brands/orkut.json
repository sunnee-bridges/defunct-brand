  "summary": "**Orkut** was Google’s first major social network, launched in **2004** and wildly popular in **Brazil** and **India**. It centered on **communities**, **scraps** (public messages), **testimonials**, and photo sharing—years before Facebook became dominant worldwide. As Google redirected effort to newer products (Buzz, then Google+), Orkut stagnated and was **shut down September 30, 2014**. Its cultural footprint remains strongest in Brazil and India, where ‘scraps’ and Orkut communities defined the mid-2000s social web.",

  "overview_md": "**Orkut** launched in **January 2004** as an invite-only social network built by Google engineer **Orkut Büyükkökten**. Its design revolved around **interest-based communities** and quick-hit **scraps** on user profiles, plus **testimonials** friends could leave. While it never led in the US, Orkut became *the* social network in **Brazil** and **India**, shaping how millions first experienced the social web.\n\nCompetition (Facebook, regional networks) and Google’s shifting attention (Buzz, then Google+) left Orkut with few updates in its later years. On **June 30, 2014**, Google announced Orkut’s end; the site **closed on 2014-09-30** with a takeout option for users to export their data. Orkut’s legacy is a mid-2000s snapshot of social networking built around shared interests—not just friend graphs.",
