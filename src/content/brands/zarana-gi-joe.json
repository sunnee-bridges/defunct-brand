Joe: A Real American Hero*, **Zarana** (Zartan’s sister, a Dreadnok) used **UV-reactive plastic** so exposed ‘skin’ **turned bluish in sunlight**—a signature play feature shared with Zartan and Zandar.

  "overview_md": "**Zarana** hit the 3.75\" *G.I. Joe* line in **1986** as a **Dreadnok** infiltrator and sister to Zartan. Her original figure featured **UV-reactive plastic** so that, in **sunlight**, exposed ‘skin’ areas **shifted to a bluish tone**, reinforcing the clan’s disguise/chameleon theme. Packed with gear and a punk-inspired sculpt, she rounded out the trio of color-changing siblings (Zartan, Zarana, Zandar).\n\nIn the **1990s and beyond**, Hasbro refreshed characters and scales, but the **sunlight color-change** was largely **retired** in favor of updated sculpts, articulation, and accessories—leaving **Zarana v1 (1986)** the iconic release for the UV effect.",
