  "fate": "The original 1986 figure's UV color-change effect was a standout feature in the Dreadnok trio. Later releases kept the character but phased out the sunlight transformation as durability and manufacturing standards evolved. Yet Zarana v1 remains iconic for being part of one of the 80s' most memorable toy innovations.",
  "summary": "Debuting in **1986** for *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero*, **Zarana** (Zartan's sister and a **Dreadnok**) featured **UV-reactive plastic** so that exposed 'skin' **turned bluish in sunlight**—a signature innovation shared with her brother Zartan and cousin Zandar. This color-shift effect wasn't just visual; kids could demo it instantly on the playground, making the trio an unforgettable part of 80s toy culture. Zarana shipped with gear befitting her punk-inspired Dreadnok aesthetic, reinforcing the clan's infiltrator identity. By the **1990s**, the UV color-change feature was phased out as manufacturing standards and durability concerns shifted focus, but Zarana remained in Hasbro's lineup through the **2000s and beyond**. Modern versions emphasize sculpt and articulation, yet the original 1986 release remains iconic—a testament to 80s toy innovation when such features defined a figure's legacy.",

  "overview_md": "**Zarana** hit the 3.75\" *G.I. Joe* line in **1986** as a **Dreadnok** infiltrator and sister to Zartan, featuring one of the era's most innovative toy effects: **UV-reactive plastic**. In **sunlight**, her exposed 'skin' areas **shifted to a striking bluish tone**—a feature kids could test instantly on any playground, making her unforgettable. Packed with gear and a punk-inspired sculpt that screamed Dreadnok attitude, Zarana completed the color-changing trio (Zartan, Zarana, Zandar) that dominated playground conversations in the mid-80s.\n\nThroughout the **late 1980s and early 1990s**, this color-change trio became legendary among collectors and kids alike. However, by the **1990s**, the **UV color-change feature was phased out** as manufacturing standards evolved and durability concerns emerged. The photochromic plastic that once made Zarana special couldn't withstand the rigors of play and storage.\n\nToday, in the **2000s and beyond**, Hasbro has refreshed Zarana across various scales and articulation systems, but the focus shifted to improved sculpts, articulation, and accessories rather than color-change effects. Yet **Zarana v1 (1986)** remains iconic—a time capsule of 80s toy innovation when a single feature could define a character's legacy. Collectors prize the original precisely because that UV effect is what made her part of a revolutionary toy moment and, ultimately, what makes her rare.",
