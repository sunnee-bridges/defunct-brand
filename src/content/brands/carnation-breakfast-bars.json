  "overview_md": "**Carnation Breakfast Bars** were a granola-style meal replacement introduced in **1975** as a portable take on Carnation’s Instant Breakfast. Coated in chocolate and marketed as a quick, nutrient-forward option for busy mornings, the bars carved out a loyal following among students and on-the-go families through the late 1970s and 1980s. After **Nestlé acquired Carnation in the mid-1980s**, the brand’s breakfast portfolio evolved, and the bars were eventually **discontinued in 1997** after a brief **1994** refresh. \n\nNostalgia kept the memory alive: recipe clones, vintage ads, and petitions frequently surface online. Nestlé later offered a **Carnation Breakfast Essentials**–branded nutrition bar in **2014**, but fans noted it wasn’t the same formula or flavor profile; that bar left shelves by **2020**. Today, Carnation Breakfast Bars are remembered as a rare crossover between snack aisle indulgence and the meal-replacement trend—distinct for their chocolate-covered granola texture and unmistakable breakfast-as-a-bar positioning. Their disappearance is a go-to example of how portfolio changes, shifting nutrition standards, and category competition can retire a product even when consumer nostalgia remains strong.",
