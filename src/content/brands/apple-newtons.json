  "overview_md": "**Apple Newtons** were a fruit-filled spin on the classic **Fig Newtons** cookie: the same soft cake exterior, but with a **spiced apple-cinnamon** filling. Sold under the **Newtons** umbrella (Nabisco/Kraft → Mondelēz), Apple joined other varieties (strawberry, raspberry, etc.) that proliferated in the **1990s–2000s** as the brand leaned into “more fruit, less cookie” positioning.\n\nAs cookie aisles consolidated and the lineup was trimmed, fringe flavors disappeared. By the **2010s**, **Apple Newtons** had effectively **vanished** from mainstream U.S. retail while core SKUs (e.g., fig, sometimes strawberry) continued. Today, Apple Newtons live on in nostalgia threads and old box photos—one of several beloved Newton flavors that didn’t survive portfolio simplification.",
