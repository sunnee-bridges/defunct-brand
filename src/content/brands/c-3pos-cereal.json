  "overview_md": "**C-3PO’s Cereal** was a limited-run, Star Wars–licensed breakfast cereal from Kellogg’s sold in 1984–1985. Marketed alongside the original trilogy’s lingering cultural moment, the box featured C-3PO and often R2-D2, while the cereal itself used distinctive double-figure-eight pieces. Positioned as a lightly sweetened corn-and-oat cereal for kids, it relied on TV spots, in-box premiums, and mail-in offers rather than any long shelf-life plan.\n\nFans remember it for three reasons: timing, design, and scarcity. It arrived as Star Wars merchandising still dominated toy aisles, the “double-8” shapes stood out next to rings and puffs, and the product vanished after roughly one year—turning empty boxes and unopened packs into collector targets. In a pre-prequel era, the branding also kept the saga visible to younger shoppers between theatrical releases and TV airings.\n\nToday, C-3PO’s lives on in ’80s cereal retrospectives, commercial compilations, and nostalgia lists. Search interest spikes around vintage food, discontinued cereals, and Star Wars memorabilia, making it a recurring query for pop-culture historians. While the recipe never returned under the same name, the cereal’s brief run is a neat snapshot of how movie licenses powered breakfast aisles—and how fast those tie-ins could disappear once campaigns ended.",
