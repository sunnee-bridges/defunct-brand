  "fate": "The original G1 Megatron toy transformed into a realistic Walther-style handgun. From the 1990s onward, mass-market releases in the U.S. largely moved to tanks or sci-fi cannons. Realistic ‘gun’ versions are generally limited, require bright markings, and are positioned for adult collectors.",
  "summary": "Early **Megatron** figures (G1, 1984) transformed into a realistic **Walther P38–style handgun**—striking on shelves but easy to mistake for a real firearm. As U.S. safety standards, retailer policies, and public perception tightened, Hasbro/Takara shifted Megatron’s alternate mode to **tanks** or **futuristic cannons**. Modern U.S. releases avoid realistic firearm forms; any handgun-based editions are typically collector imports with **blaze-orange plugs** and other compliance markings.",

  "overview_md": "In **1984**, *Transformers* launched with a bold idea: **Megatron**, the Decepticon leader, transformed into a realistic, Walther-style handgun. The toy’s chrome finish and working mechanics made it memorable — and increasingly problematic. As U.S. **toy firearm marking rules** (blaze-orange tips), retailer standards, and public concerns grew through the late 1980s/1990s, Hasbro/Takara **pivoted Megatron’s alt-mode** toward **tanks** and **futuristic cannons** that read as fantasy rather than real-steel.\n\nCollector-aimed handgun versions haven’t vanished entirely, but modern U.S. distribution typically requires an **orange plug** and conspicuous markings; many retailers avoid realistic toy guns altogether. The result: for most fans, the default modern Megatron is a **tank/cannon**, while the old pistol form survives as a niche collector throwback.\n\n**Why the change?** A mix of **safety compliance** (blaze-orange tips & imitation-firearm rules), **retailer policy**, and **brand risk** (confusability with real firearms, PR concerns). The franchise found a durable solution: keep the character’s silhouette and menace, but shift the alt-mode to something clearly fictional or militarized (tanks) that satisfies both safety expectations and play value.",
