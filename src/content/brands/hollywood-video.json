  "summary": "**Hollywood Video** grew into the No. 2 U.S. video-rental chain through the 1990s, competing head-to-head with Blockbuster on big-box stores, new releases, and late-fee promos. After a 2005 acquisition by **Movie Gallery**, heavy debt, shrinking DVD rentals, and the rise of mail/streaming services pushed the business into bankruptcy. By **2010**, the parent liquidated and Hollywood Video stores closed nationwide. *Fun fact:* many locations housed an in-store game shop called **Game Crazy**, which ran trade-ins years before that model became mainstream.",
