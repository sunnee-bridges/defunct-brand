  "overview_md": "**Pan Am** (Pan American World Airways) was synonymous with the jet age. Founded in **1927**, the airline grew from Caribbean mail routes into a global network that introduced generations of travelers to international air travel. With its signature **Clipper** branding and globe logo, Pan Am set standards for cabin service, route planning, and aviation style—training stewards, commissioning bespoke uniforms, and anchoring prestige terminals.\n\nPan Am helped usher in long-haul jet travel, launching **Boeing 707** transatlantic service in **1958** and later flying 747s on high-profile routes. Yet structural challenges mounted: deregulation, fuel shocks, currency swings, and intensifying competition pressed margins. The costly **National Airlines** acquisition in **1980** added debt without delivering sufficient network synergies. Tragedy struck in **1988** with the bombing of **Flight 103** over Lockerbie, Scotland, further damaging finances and brand confidence.\n\nBy **1991**, asset sales—including prized Heathrow routes—couldn’t stabilize the company. Pan Am sought Chapter 11 protection and attempted a slimmed-down network with a Miami hub, but funding collapsed; operations ended that December. The brand endures as an aviation icon—remembered for pioneering global service, ushering in the jet age, and defining the romance of international flight—even as its collapse marks a cautionary tale about leverage, shocks, and industry upheaval.",
