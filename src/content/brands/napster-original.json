  "overview_md": "**Napster (original)** was the catalyst of the MP3 era. Launched in **1999** by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, it paired a simple Windows client with a **central index of user libraries**, making it effortless to search and swap songs across millions of PCs. College campuses and broadband households adopted it at viral speed; for many, Napster was the first experience of instant, on-demand access to nearly any track.\n\nThat popularity collided with music-industry rights. Major labels and artists (famously **Metallica** and **Dr. Dre**) sued, arguing Napster enabled widespread infringement. Because the directory and authentication were centralized, courts found Napster had knowledge and control sufficient to impose liability and injunctions. A district court ordered the service to block infringing files; the **Ninth Circuit** largely affirmed, and Napster went offline in **July 2001** to comply. The company subsequently entered **Chapter 11** in **2002**, with assets changing hands and the **Napster** name later reappearing on fully licensed services.\n\nNapster’s legacy is twofold: it normalized digital, track-based listening for a generation, and it pushed labels and tech toward licensed downloads and streaming. It also remains a case study in how architecture (centralized vs. decentralized) shapes both user experience and legal exposure.",
