The SKU has cycled in and out of national distribution—**discontinued in the late 1990s**, revived in the **2000s**, and widely reintroduced around **2014**—but today remains a recognized, rotating core flavor alongside Caramel.",

  "overview_md": "**Peanut Butter Twix** (aka **Twix PB**) is the long-running peanut-butter spin on Mars’ biscuit-bar classic. Instead of caramel over a shortbread finger, PB Twix uses a **peanut-butter layer** on a **chocolate cookie base**, then coats the bar in milk chocolate. U.S. shoppers first saw it in the **1980s**, it went **missing in the late 1990s**, returned in the **2000s** (with packaging shifting between “Twix PB” and “Peanut Butter Twix”), and by the **mid-2010s** it was back in broad distribution. Availability still varies by retailer and season, but as of 2025 it’s commonly found in standard and share sizes.",
