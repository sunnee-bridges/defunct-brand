  "overview_md": "**Zune** was Microsoft’s bid to rival the iPod with tightly integrated hardware, software, and the **Zune Pass** music subscription. Launched in **2006**, early Zunes emphasized Wi-Fi sharing and a bold UI; the **Zune HD** (2009) earned praise for its OLED display, capacitive touch, and snappy NVIDIA Tegra chipset. Despite a loyal following, Zune never reached iPod scale, and Microsoft wound down the hardware as it prioritized Windows Phone and, later, Xbox-branded music services.\n\nIn today’s climate, interest in **standalone music players** has ticked up again. Some listeners are frustrated that streaming fees keep rising and that access can vanish when licenses change—highlighting the difference between **renting** and **owning** music. Nostalgic Zune owners and new hobbyists alike value offline libraries, long battery life, and distraction-free listening. That doesn’t make Zune “current,” but it explains why refurbished units and modern DAPs see renewed attention: they restore a sense of collection ownership, predictable costs, and control over audio quality.\n\nZune’s design language—typography-forward, metro-influenced, and playful—left a mark on Microsoft UX. Its story is a time capsule of the shift from personal media libraries to cloud subscriptions, and the pendulum that occasionally swings back toward local files and dedicated devices.",
