The product line struggled against iPod/iTunes and the rapid shift to smartphones. Zune hardware was discontinued in 2011, and the Zune brand was sunset in 2012, with remaining services and technology transitioning into Microsoft’s later music offerings.",

 "overview_md": "**Zune** was Microsoft’s end-to-end music platform—portable players, the Zune desktop app, Marketplace, and the **Zune Pass** subscription. It introduced Wi-Fi track sharing and a distinctive, typography-forward UI. The lineup evolved from the original Zune 30 to later HDD and flash models, culminating in the **Zune HD** (2009), which earned strong reviews for its hardware and interface. As iPod/iTunes dominance and smartphones reshaped the market, Zune’s momentum faded. Microsoft discontinued **Zune hardware in 2011**, and sunset the **Zune brand in 2012**; remaining services and underlying tech continued transitioning into Microsoft’s later music offerings before those services were eventually retired.",
