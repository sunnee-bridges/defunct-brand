  "overview_md": "**Pets.com** was a late-1990s online retailer that tried to move the pet aisle to the web. Launched in **1998**, the company leaned on heavy brand marketing—most memorably a wisecracking **sock-puppet** that became a pop-culture fixture and appeared in national TV spots and a Super Bowl ad. The pitch resonated with awareness, but economics lagged the attention: bulky, low-margin pet goods (kibble, litter) were expensive to ship and hard to make profitable without scale, repeat purchase behavior, and tight logistics.\n\nBacked by prominent investors and partnerships, Pets.com expanded quickly and rolled out nationwide fulfillment while pricing aggressively to win share. In **early 2000** it completed an IPO during the peak of dot-com exuberance. Within months, tightening capital markets and rising customer-acquisition costs exposed the model’s fragility. Despite strong traffic and name recognition, contribution margins stayed thin and marketing spend remained high. By **late 2000**, the company announced it would cease operations and liquidate, selling intellectual property and inventory.\n\nToday, Pets.com is shorthand for the **dot-com bubble**—a case study in the gap between brand fame and unit economics. The sock-puppet lives on as cultural memory, while the lesson about shipping-heavy, low-margin categories remains part of e-commerce strategy playbooks.",
