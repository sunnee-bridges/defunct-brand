  "overview_md": "The **Red Edition** debuted in the early 2010s with **cranberry** as its U.S. flavor. For years the can read *The Red Edition (Cranberry)* alongside Blue (Blueberry) and Silver (Lime). Around **2020**, Red Bull shifted the U.S. Red Edition to **Watermelon**, and the cranberry SKU exited mainstream distribution. The *Red Edition* name stayed—only the taste changed—so fans generally treat cranberry as a **discontinued U.S. flavor**.",
