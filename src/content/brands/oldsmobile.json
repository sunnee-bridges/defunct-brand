  "overview_md": "**Oldsmobile** (1897–2004) was one of America’s foundational car marques and the **oldest U.S. brand** still in production when it was retired. Founded by **Ransom E. Olds**, the company helped popularize early mass production with the **Curved Dash** in the early 1900s. Through the postwar decades Oldsmobile became a GM pillar, known for smooth Rocket V8s and a ladder of models that fit millions of driveways. The brand’s identity peaked with nameplates like **Cutlass/Cutlass Supreme**, the muscle-leaning **442**, the long-running **88/98**, and the **1966 Toronado**, a striking, powerful **front-wheel-drive** halo that showcased GM’s engineering swagger.\n\nBy the late 1980s and 1990s, differentiation inside GM’s multi-brand portfolio blurred. The infamous line—“**This is not your father’s Oldsmobile**”—captured a real problem: trying to court younger buyers while a loyal base aged. Meanwhile **Buick** encroached on similar territory, and marketing budgets fragmented. In **2000**, GM announced a **phase-out** of Oldsmobile, citing **overlap, dealer realities, and declining demand**. The final car, an **Alero** built in **2004**, closed a run of more than a century. Today Oldsmobile is remembered for democratizing technology—automatic transmissions, FWD sophistication—and for models that defined American family and performance motoring across generations.",
