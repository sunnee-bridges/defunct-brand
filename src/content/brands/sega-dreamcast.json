  "overview_md": "**Dreamcast** was Sega’s forward-looking final console. Debuting in Japan in **1998** and North America on the iconic **9/9/99**, it shipped with a built-in modem—normalizing online play from day one—and a compact **GD-ROM** format. The system courted developers with a Hitachi SH-4/PowerVR 2D–3D pipeline and optional **Windows CE** middleware, while players got crisp VGA output, sleek industrial design, and the quirky **VMU** (a memory card with a screen that doubled as a mini companion device).\n\nIts library punched above its weight: **Soulcalibur**, **Crazy Taxi**, **Jet Set Radio**, **Shenmue**, **NFL 2K**, and **Phantasy Star Online** (one of the first console online RPGs) showcased arcade-grade visuals and inventive mechanics. In the U.S., Sega pushed a dedicated ISP, **SegaNet**, for low-latency matchmaking.\n\nDespite critical praise, the platform struggled against **PlayStation 2** hype and DVD playback (which Dreamcast lacked), uneven third-party support, and rising piracy exploits. On **January 31, 2001**, Sega announced it would discontinue Dreamcast hardware and shift to software publishing; production wound down that spring. The console’s influence endures in cel-shaded art, online console services, and fan communities that still celebrate its experimental spirit.",
