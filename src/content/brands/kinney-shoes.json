  "summary": "Founded in 1894 by George R. Kinney, **Kinney Shoes** grew into a nationwide, value-priced footwear chain. Acquired by **F.W. Woolworth** in the 1960s, Kinney later **created Foot Locker in 1974** as an athletic-focused specialty concept. As Woolworth restructured in the late 1990s, it shuttered the remaining Kinney stores in **1998** and concentrated on the faster-growing Foot Locker banners. The corporate lineage lives on as **Foot Locker, Inc.**, but Kinney-branded stores are gone.",

  "overview_md": "**Kinney Shoes** began in 1894 and became a coast-to-coast shoe retailer known for affordable family footwear. Under **F.W. Woolworth** ownership, Kinney incubated the specialty athletic concept **Foot Locker** (1974), which quickly outpaced the legacy Kinney format. During Woolworth’s late-1990s restructuring, the company closed the remaining **Kinney** stores in **1998** to focus on athletic banners; the parent later became **Foot Locker, Inc.** Kinney’s name vanished, but its most successful offshoot defines the successor company.",
