  "overview_md": "Best Buy Mobile was a mall-format phone shop that peaked during the smarphone boom. After opening in 2006, the stores were designed to be smaller than traditional Best Buy stores, and specialized solely in mobile devices, helping customers set up their phones before leaving the store.\n\nUltimately, Best Buy Mobile couldn't carve out enough of a footprint that separated it from its parent Best Buy stores, or other stores and products that were arriving on the market.\n\n Best Buy Mobile stores were a tiny footprint in the company's overall sales and real estate locations - approximately 1 percent each. Combined with the fact that most mobile shops were in close proximity to big-box Best Buy stores, the decision to consolidate seemed inevitable. ",
