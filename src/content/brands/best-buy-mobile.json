  "summary": "Launched in 2007 during the early smartphone surge, **Best Buy Mobile** was a small-format concept focused on carrier activations, phones, plans, and accessories. It expanded quickly into malls and strip centers, then wound down as carriers pushed their own stores, online upgrades grew, and margins tightened. **Fun fact:** the concept began as a joint effort with **Carphone Warehouse**, and it popularized the in-store setup promise branded **“Walk Out Working.”**",
