  "overview_md": "**BlackBerry (legacy OS)** refers to smartphones running **BlackBerry OS** (and later **BlackBerry 10**)—devices that popularized secure, push email and the QWERTY candy-bar form factor for business and government users. Starting from two-way email pagers in **1999**, BlackBerry’s integrated phone + email handsets (e.g., **Curve**, **Bold**) became cultural touchstones—so habit-forming they earned the “CrackBerry” nickname. Core strengths included **end-to-end encryption**, **BES/BIS** services, efficient battery life, and physical keyboards that enabled fast, accurate typing.\n\nAs the market shifted to large touchscreens and expansive app ecosystems after **2007**, BlackBerry struggled to match the pace of **iOS** and **Android**. Attempts to bridge the gap included the touch-centric **Storm** line and, later, the **BlackBerry 10** platform (2013) with gesture navigation and a new runtime. Despite loyal enterprise and messaging users, developer traction and consumer share declined. In **2016**, BlackBerry announced it would **cease in-house phone development** and pivot to software and security; the **BlackBerry** name subsequently appeared on **Android** devices via licensing (TCL, and later other partners). Legacy network services for older devices were eventually turned off.\n\nBlackBerry’s legacy endures in secure mobility, MDM/EMM software, and the enduring appeal of compact QWERTY phones—even as mainstream smartphones moved decisively to full-screen slabs.",
