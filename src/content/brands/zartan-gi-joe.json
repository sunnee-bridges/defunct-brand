  "summary": "Hasbro’s **Zartan** debuted in **1984** for *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero* with a signature gimmick: his exposed ‘skin’ plastic shifted to a **bluish** tone in **sunlight (UV exposure)**. Packed with a removable mask and the **Chameleon Swamp Skier**, Zartan quickly became a fan-favorite. Later versions kept the character but generally dropped the UV color-change feature due to material and durability tradeoffs.",

  "overview_md": "**Zartan** entered the 3.75-inch *G.I. Joe* line in **1984** as Cobra’s chameleon-like infiltrator. The v1 figure used UV-reactive plastic so that, in **sunlight**, his ‘skin’ **shifted to a bluish color**—a standout 80s gimmick that kids could demo instantly on the playground. He shipped as a deluxe figure with the **Chameleon Swamp Skier**, a hood, chest armor, and a removable **mask** to sell the disguise theme.\n\nThroughout the late 80s and into the 90s, Hasbro refreshed Zartan and related characters, sometimes experimenting with temperature/UV-reactive parts. Over time, the **UV color-change** was **retired** as materials and safety/durability standards evolved, and as the line cycled toward new play features. Modern Zartan figures focus on sculpt, articulation, and accessories rather than photochromic plastic—but the 1984 version remains iconic for its **sunlight color shift**.",
