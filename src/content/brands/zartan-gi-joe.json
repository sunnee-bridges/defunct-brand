  "fate": "The original 1980s figure's groundbreaking UV color-change gimmick was phased out by the 1990s due to material durability tradeoffs. The character endures in modern G.I. Joe lines without the photochromic effect, but the 1984 version remains a nostalgia icon for its transformative playground appeal.",
  "summary": "Hasbro's **Zartan** debuted in **1984** for *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero* with a groundbreaking innovation: his exposed 'skin' plastic shifted to a **bluish** tone in **sunlight (UV exposure)**. This wasn't just visual—kids could test it on the playground in real-time, making Zartan one of the most memorable figures of the era. He shipped as a deluxe package with the **Chameleon Swamp Skier**, removable mask, and chest armor, reinforcing his infiltrator identity. By the **1990s**, the UV color-change feature was phased out as safety and durability standards evolved, but Zartan remained in Hasbro's lineup through the **2000s and beyond**. Modern versions emphasize sculpt and articulation, yet the original 1984 release remains iconic—a reminder of 80s toy innovation when such features were as important as the figure itself.",

  "overview_md": "**Zartan** entered the 3.75-inch *G.I. Joe* line in **1984** as Cobra's chameleon-like infiltrator, featuring one of the era's most innovative toy features: UV-reactive plastic. In **sunlight**, his exposed 'skin' **shifted to a striking bluish color**—a feature that kids could demo instantly on any playground, making Zartan unforgettable. He shipped as a deluxe figure with the **Chameleon Swamp Skier**, hood, chest armor, and a removable **mask** that sold the disguise theme.\n\nThroughout the **late 1980s and early 1990s**, Hasbro expanded the character with related figures like Zarana and Zandar, sometimes experimenting with their own color-change plastics or temperature-reactive decals. However, by the **1990s**, the **UV color-change feature was phased out** as manufacturing standards evolved and durability concerns emerged. The photochromic plastic that once made Zartan special couldn't withstand the rigors of play and storage.\n\nToday, modern Zartan figures (from the **2000s onward**) focus on improved sculpt, articulation, and accessories rather than color-change effects. Yet the **1984 original remains iconic**—a time capsule of 80s toy innovation when a feature could define a figure's legacy. Collectors prize the vintage version precisely because that UV effect is what made it revolutionary and, ultimately, what made it rare.",
