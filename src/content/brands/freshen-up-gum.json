After multiple ownership changes, it quietly disappeared from U.S. shelves in the 2010s and is generally regarded as discontinued here.",

  "overview_md": "**Freshen-Up** was the original **liquid-center chewing gum** in the U.S., launched in **1975** by **American Chicle**. Its entire pitch was the **liquid burst**—you’d bite in and the center would “**go squirt**,” a line the brand made famous in advertising. Classic flavors included Peppermint, Spearmint, Cinnamon, and Bubble Gum.\n\nThrough the late 20th century the brand passed from American Chicle to **Adams/Cadbury Adams** and later into the Kraft/Mondelez orbit. By the **2010s**, Freshen-Up had **vanished from U.S. retail** and is no longer listed on current owner product pages, so collectors and nostalgia threads treat it as **discontinued in the U.S.** The liquid-center idea still pops up elsewhere, but the original Freshen-Up mostly survives as a memory for American shoppers.",
