  "summary": "Introduced in 1975 by American Chicle (later Adams/Cadbury Adams), Freshen-Up was a liquid-center chewing gum—bite to release a flavored burst—sold in Peppermint, Spearmint, Cinnamon, Bubble Gum, and a 1970s fruit variant. The product pioneered the \"fun gum\" category with its distinctive \"the gum that goes squirt\" tagline. While U.S. distribution ended in the early 2000s, production shifted to Brazil where the brand remained viable until global discontinuation in 2019.",

  "overview_md": "**Freshen-Up** was the original **liquid-center chewing gum** in the U.S., launched in **1975** by **American Chicle**, a subsidiary of Warner-Lambert Company. Its entire pitch was the **liquid burst**—you'd bite in and the center would \"**go squirt**,\" a line the brand made famous in advertising. Classic flavors included Peppermint, Spearmint, Cinnamon, Bubble Gum, and a fruit variant introduced in the 1970s.\n\nThe product's manufacturing proved complex and expensive. In **1976**, an explosion at the American Chicle factory in Queens, New York killed six workers, underscoring the technical challenges of encapsulating liquid centers in gum. This incident highlighted why production costs remained persistently high.\n\nThrough the late 20th century, the brand passed from American Chicle to **Adams/Cadbury Adams** and later into the Kraft/Mondelez orbit. By the **early 2000s**, Freshen-Up had **vanished from U.S. retail** as consumer preferences shifted and production complexity made it unprofitable in the American market.\n\nInterestingly, while the product disappeared from American shelves, **manufacturing shifted to Brazil under Cadbury Adams**, where Freshen-Up became the brand's strongest international market. Brazilian-manufactured Freshen-Up was exported to North America and other markets throughout the 2010s, sustaining the brand through continued production despite global challenges in the gum sector. The product remained available through these channels until **2019**, when Cadbury Adams discontinued the brand globally as part of broader corporate shifts toward higher-growth confectionery lines.\n\nToday, Freshen-Up is remembered as a defining 1970s-1980s product—a nostalgic touchstone for those who experienced its unique \"squirting\" sensation and era-defining advertising campaigns.",
