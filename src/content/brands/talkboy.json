  "overview_md": "**Talkboy** is the quintessential **’90s movie-to-toy** success story. Shown as a kid’s gadget in *Home Alone 2* (**1992**), the prop generated so much interest that **Tiger Electronics** released a **real Talkboy** soon after. The handheld **cassette recorder** let kids **record**, **play back**, and—on the **Deluxe** model—**change playback speed** to deepen or raise their voice (perfect for prank calls and Kevin-style hijinks). A color-swapped **Talkgirl** targeted the broader kid market, and bite-size **FX** spinoffs added sound-effect buttons.\n\nTalkboy rode the early-’90s wave of **movie tie-ins** and **low-cost electronics** to become a holiday hit. But as **digital players**, **mini-disc/MP3**, and later **phones** replaced cassette gadgets, the line faded. By the **late 1990s/early 2000s**, Talkboy was **discontinued**, living on as a nostalgia icon—and a reminder that one perfect movie moment can launch a real-world toy craze.",
