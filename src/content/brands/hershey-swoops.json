  "overview_md": "**Hershey’s Swoops** were thin, curved chocolate pieces—visually similar to potato chips—packed in a rigid canister for ‘stackable’ portioning. The idea rode early-2000s snack trends (portable, resealable, portion control) and leveraged Hershey sub-brands like **Reese’s** and **York**. In practice, Swoops ran into several frictions: higher unit price than bars, smaller perceived value, and a form factor that **melted easily** and didn’t match how people ate chocolate. Merchandising also proved awkward—candy aisle shoppers looked for bars and bags, not canisters. Despite flavor extensions, the line faded and was **discontinued by mid-2000s**. Today it’s a nostalgic footnote in big-brand product experiments.",
