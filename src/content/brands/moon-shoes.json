  "summary": "Strap-on bounce platforms marketed as ‘mini-trampolines for your feet,’ Moon Shoes were a 1990s staple in kids’ infomercials and Nickelodeon ad breaks. Players stood in hard plastic frames with heavy elastic bands to get a springy, moon-walk feel. Fun and iconic—but bulky, noisy, and prone to ankle tweaks—so the craze waned as the decade ended.",

  "overview_md": "**Moon Shoes**—often billed as *“mini-trampolines for your feet”*—let kids strap into rigid plastic platforms laced with thick elastic bands to add a spring to each step. The look (chunky frames and bright colors) and the promise (a ‘moon-walk’ bounce) fit perfectly into **1990s** kids’ TV culture, with heavy rotation during Nickelodeon blocks and weekend cartoon hours.\n\nThey delivered momentary thrills but weren’t exactly graceful: the bounce was choppy, they were loud on sidewalks, and rolled ankles weren’t uncommon if you landed off-center. As the fad cooled and safety-minded toys rose, **shelf space shrank**. By the early **2000s** they’d mostly disappeared, resurfacing now and then in nostalgia-themed reissues or limited regional runs.\n\nToday, Moon Shoes live on in memory (and in old commercials on YouTube) as a snapshot of 90s toy marketing—big promises, bright plastic, and a catchy pitch you could hear between episodes of your favorite Nick shows.",
