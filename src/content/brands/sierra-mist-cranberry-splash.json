  "overview_md": "**Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash** was a limited-edition cranberry-flavored variant of PepsiCo's Sierra Mist lemon-lime soda released seasonally during the holidays from approximately 2006 to 2016. With its distinctive bright red color and tart cranberry-citrus flavor combination, Cranberry Splash developed a devoted following among fans who eagerly anticipated its annual return before it quietly disappeared from shelves.\n\nSierra Mist itself launched in **1999** as PepsiCo's answer to Sprite and 7-Up, positioning itself as a natural alternative with no caffeine and initially real sugar. The brand struggled to gain market share against Coca-Cola's dominant Sprite but maintained a loyal customer base throughout the 2000s.\n\n**Cranberry Splash debuted around 2006** as a seasonal holiday offering, typically appearing in stores from October through December. The timing was strategic—cranberry flavors are associated with Thanksgiving and Christmas, and the bright red soda fit holiday aesthetics. PepsiCo marketed it as a festive mixer for holiday parties and family gatherings.\n\nThe flavor profile was **distinctive and polarizing**. Cranberry Splash combined Sierra Mist's crisp lemon-lime base with tart cranberry flavoring, creating a sweet-tart balance more complex than standard lemon-lime sodas. The cranberry wasn't subtle—it dominated the taste, giving the soda a bold, fruity character. The bright red color made it visually striking, especially in clear bottles or glasses.\n\nFor fans, Cranberry Splash became a **holiday tradition**. People looked forward to its annual appearance the way others anticipated Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte or McDonald's Shamrock Shake. The limited availability created urgency—if you didn't stock up during the holiday season, you'd wait another year. Some fans bought cases to last beyond the holidays.\n\nThe soda worked well as a **cocktail mixer**, which expanded its appeal beyond soda drinkers. The cranberry-citrus combination paired naturally with vodka, creating festive holiday cocktails. Recipe blogs and party planning sites featured Cranberry Splash in holiday drink recipes, building a use case beyond simple soda consumption.\n\n**Marketing was minimal** compared to other PepsiCo launches. Cranberry Splash relied primarily on in-store placement and existing Sierra Mist brand recognition rather than major advertising campaigns. The seasonal nature and limited distribution meant PepsiCo didn't invest heavily in promotion—the product succeeded through word-of-mouth and repeat customers.\n\nHowever, the limited seasonal release also meant **sales data was concentrated** into just three months annually. If holiday sales disappointed any given year, the product's entire annual performance looked weak. This vulnerability likely contributed to the eventual discontinuation.\n\nBy the **mid-2010s**, Sierra Mist as a brand was struggling. Market share remained stubbornly low despite reformulations and rebranding attempts. PepsiCo was reconsidering its entire lemon-lime strategy, which put seasonal variants like Cranberry Splash at risk.\n\n**Cranberry Splash quietly disappeared around 2016**, though the exact discontinuation date is unclear because it was seasonal—fans didn't realize it was gone until the 2017 holiday season arrived without it. Social media filled with disappointed posts: \"Where's Cranberry Splash this year?\" \"Did they discontinue it?\" The absence was noticed but never officially explained by PepsiCo.\n\nThe discontinuation sparked **online campaigns** asking PepsiCo to bring back Cranberry Splash. Facebook posts, tweets, and Reddit threads expressed frustration. Some fans claimed to have contacted PepsiCo customer service and received vague responses about \"portfolio optimization\" and \"evolving consumer preferences.\" No formal announcement ever came.\n\nSierra Mist itself went through multiple identity crises after Cranberry Splash disappeared. The brand was reformulated several times, changed sweeteners, and struggled to differentiate itself. In **2023**, PepsiCo made the dramatic decision to **discontinue Sierra Mist entirely**, replacing it with a new lemon-lime soda called **Starry**. This killed any remaining hope for Cranberry Splash's return.\n\nFor fans, Cranberry Splash represented more than just a flavored soda—it was a **holiday ritual**. The appearance of red Sierra Mist bottles signaled the start of holiday season. Families served it at Thanksgiving dinner. Holiday party hosts stocked it for guests. The discontinuation felt like losing a small but meaningful piece of holiday tradition.\n\nThe lack of **comparable alternatives** increased the disappointment. While cranberry-flavored sodas exist (Schweppes Cranberry Ginger Ale, various cranberry Sprites in some markets), none replicate Cranberry Splash's specific flavor profile. Sprite Cranberry, launched by Coca-Cola in 2013, became popular and fills part of the void, but fans insist it tastes different—sweeter and less tart than the original Cranberry Splash.\n\nToday, **Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash** exists only in memory and occasional unopened cans that surface on eBay. With Sierra Mist itself discontinued in 2023, the brand won't return under its original name. PepsiCo's new Starry brand could theoretically launch a cranberry variant, but nothing has been announced.\n\nThe story of Cranberry Splash reflects **challenges of seasonal products**. Limited releases create excitement and urgency but provide limited sales data and operational complexity. A product that delights customers three months annually may still get cut if it complicates distribution or doesn't align with corporate strategy.\n\nFor 2000s and 2010s consumers who remember it, Cranberry Splash represents a specific holiday aesthetic—family gatherings, festive drinks, the optimism of seasonal rituals before everything felt complicated. The soda wasn't just carbonated cranberry flavor; it was bottled holiday nostalgia that can no longer be purchased.",
