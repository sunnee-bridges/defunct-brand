  "overview_md": "American Apparel began in 1989 as a North Carolina-based wholesale T-shirt maker and grew into a vertically integrated fashion brand centered on Los Angeles manufacturing, rapid replenishment, and minimalist basics—T-shirts, hoodies, leggings, and bodysuits. Its stores highlighted \"Made in USA\" labor messaging and a distinctive, often provocative advertising style that made the label a pop-culture fixture in the 2000s. By mid-decade the company expanded from wholesale into hundreds of branded stores, supported by in-house cutting, sewing, and dyeing that enabled quick turns and color range.\n\nRapid growth, leverage, and operational complexity—plus intensifying competition from fast fashion and e-commerce—strained margins. Governance controversies and leadership turmoil further distracted the business. The company restructured after filing for Chapter 11 in 2015, then filed again in 2016 as sales and liquidity pressures continued. In early 2017, Gildan Activewear acquired the American Apparel trademarks and certain assets. Remaining U.S. stores were liquidated. Under new ownership, the brand continued primarily online/wholesale, leveraging name’s recognition while themmmmm retail footprint disappeared.\n\nFor many shoppers, American Apparel still evokes a specific aesthetic—clean basics, saturated color palettes, cotton jersey—and a moment when \"Made in USA\" branding was central to a mall era that has largely shifted to digital.",
