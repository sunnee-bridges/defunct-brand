  "overview_md": "**American Apparel** (the original company) began in **1989** as a wholesale T-shirt maker and grew into a vertically integrated fashion brand centered on **Los Angeles manufacturing**, rapid replenishment, and minimalist **basics**—T-shirts, hoodies, leggings, and bodysuits. Its stores highlighted \"**Made in USA**\" labor messaging and a distinctive, often **provocative** advertising style that made the label a pop-culture fixture in the 2000s. By mid-decade the company expanded from wholesale into hundreds of branded stores, supported by in-house cutting, sewing, and dyeing that enabled quick turns and color breadth.\n\nRapid growth, leverage, and operational complexity—plus intensifying competition from **fast fashion** and e-commerce—strained margins. Governance controversies and leadership turmoil further distracted the business. The company **filed Chapter 11 in 2015**, restructured, then filed **again in 2016** as sales and liquidity pressures persisted. In early **2017**, **Gildan Activewear** acquired the **American Apparel** trademarks and certain assets; remaining U.S. stores were liquidated. Under new ownership, the brand continued primarily **online/wholesale**, leveraging the name’s recognition while the original vertically integrated retail footprint disappeared.\n\nFor many shoppers, American Apparel still evokes a specific aesthetic—clean basics, saturated color palettes, cotton jersey—and a moment when \"Made in USA\" sourcing and brand attitude were central to a mall era that has largely shifted to digital.",
