  "overview_md": "**Netscape** helped ignite the consumer web. Founded in **1994** (originally Mosaic Communications), the company shipped **Netscape Navigator**, a fast, approachable browser that made web pages, images, and links feel immediate. Navigator’s popularity turned the browser into everyday software and Netscape into a bellwether—its **1995 IPO** became an emblem of early internet exuberance. Netscape followed with **Communicator**, bundling email, newsgroups, Composer, and admin tools into a suite that anchored many offices’ early intranet life.\n\nCompetition escalated as **Microsoft Internet Explorer** shipped aggressively and was bundled with Windows, reshaping distribution. In **1998**, Netscape released its code as **Mozilla**, seeding an open-source project that would later influence **Firefox** and modern browser engines. Netscape’s own product line rebooted on the new codebase (Netscape 6/7) while the firm pursued portals, ad tech, and enterprise servers.\n\nIn **1999**, **AOL acquired Netscape**, and over the 2000s the Netscape-branded browser waned. Official support ended in **2008**, but its legacy persists in open standards, the rise of independent browser foundations, and a generation of developers who learned the web on Navigator. Netscape’s arc—from breakout browser to open-source seed—maps the web’s shift from proprietary competition to community-driven engines and rapid standards evolution.",
