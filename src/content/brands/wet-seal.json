  "summary": "Founded in 1962 (originally as a surf shop that evolved into junior fashion), Wet Seal became a mall staple in the 1990s–2000s and also owned Arden B and former Contempo Casuals locations. Debt, shrinking mall traffic, and fast-fashion competition led to Chapter 11 in 2015 and a second collapse in 2017, when all remaining stores closed and the brand shifted to online-only under new owners.",
