  "overview_md": "**KB Toys** (often styled **Kay-Bee Toys**) grew from a small New England business into one of the most recognizable **mall-based toy chains** in the United States. By the 1980s–1990s it was a fixture of enclosed malls and outlet centers, famous for wall-to-wall peg hooks, overstock bargains, and the red clearance bins that drew kids on weekend outings. The company leaned heavily on **fourth-quarter sales**—Black Friday through Christmas—supplemented by catalogs and seasonal kiosks that expanded footprint during peak demand.\n\nThe retail landscape shifted, however. **Big-box competitors** and **e-commerce** squeezed margins, while the decline of many regional malls reduced casual foot traffic. Toy retail also carries inventory risk: fads turn quickly, movie tie-ins are cyclical, and recalls can be costly. After a **Chapter 11** restructuring in **2004**, KB Toys emerged smaller but still seasonal-dependent. The **2008 financial crisis** sharply curtailed holiday spending; the chain filed for bankruptcy again that December and began going-out-of-business sales, with most stores closing in **2009**.\n\nSince then, the **KB Toys** name has resurfaced periodically online or in proposed popup concepts, a testament to its strong **nostalgia** factor among shoppers who remember spontaneous mall stops, aisle endcaps piled with action figures, and last-minute stocking stuffers grabbed en route to the food court.",
