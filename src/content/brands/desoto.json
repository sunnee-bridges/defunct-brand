  "overview_md": "**DeSoto** was Chrysler’s mid-price brand, launched in **1928** to slot between value and premium makes and to meet the fierce competition from GM’s laddered lineup. Named after explorer **Hernando de Soto**, the marque scored a strong debut year and quickly established a reputation for roomy bodies, dependable drivetrains, and features that migrated down from Chrysler. In **1934** DeSoto embraced streamlining with the **Airflow**, a radical, aerodynamic design that proved influential even if sales were mixed; the following **Airstream** tempered the look for broader appeal.\n\nPost-war DeSotos rode the boom with **Firedome**, **Fireflite**, and later **Adventurer** trims, benefitting from Virgil Exner’s **‘Forward Look’** styling—longer, lower, and finned. But structural challenges mounted. The **1957–58 recession** hit mid-price buyers hard, quality stumbles across the corporation eroded confidence, and dealer conflicts grew as **Dodge** moved upmarket and **Chrysler** pushed down, squeezing DeSoto’s space. By 1960 Chrysler management opted to simplify its portfolio: the **1961** DeSoto line was pared to two models for a short run before the division was closed.\n\nToday DeSoto stands as a case study in **brand positioning**—how economic cycles, internal overlap, and product timing can undo a once-healthy marque. Collectors prize the late-’50s fin cars and the historically significant Airflow for their design ambition and place in American automotive history.",
