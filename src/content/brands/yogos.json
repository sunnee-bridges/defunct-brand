  "fate": "Discontinued in the U.S. around 2010 after just five years on shelves. Despite fervent fan campaigns and Change.org petitions, Kellogg's has never officially brought them back.

  "summary": "**Yogos** were Kellogg's audacious mid-2000s snack innovation: bite-size fruit centers wrapped in a tangy yogurt-style coating, sold in single-serve pouches aimed squarely at kids. Launched in **2005** with heavy TV advertising that made them instantly iconic, Yogos combined the texture novelty kids craved with familiar fruit snack appeal. The line expanded to **Yogos Bits** in **2007**—a mini format that fans still clamor for today. By **2010**, however, Yogos had vanished from shelves, a victim of portfolio consolidation, changing parental preferences toward transparent ingredients, and the snack industry's relentless churn. What made Yogos remarkable wasn't just their unique taste—it was their meteoric rise and equally swift disappearance, cementing them as one of the 2000s' most missed discontinued snacks. Today, fan campaigns like Change.org petitions keep the legend alive, proving that some products transcend their brief shelf life to become cultural touchstones.",

  "overview_md": "**Yogos** were Kellogg's bold mid-2000s entry into the kids' snack category, launching in **2005** with a simple but revolutionary concept: chewy fruit centers encased in a sweet-tart yogurt-style shell. Sold in colorful single-serve pouches with heavy TV advertising that made them instantly recognizable on store shelves and in backpacks, Yogos represented everything kids wanted—texture innovation, tangy-sweet flavor, and the aura of 'cool factor' that animated ads provided.\n\nThe snack wasn't just a hit; it was a **phenomenon**. Kids begged parents for them, traded them, and made them a staple of mid-2000s snacking culture. In **2007**, Kellogg's capitalized on the momentum by launching **Yogos Bits**—smaller spheres in a multi-piece format that many fans argue was even *better* than the original. The brand rotated flavors and collaborated with trending properties, keeping the line fresh and desirable.\n\nBut success was short-lived. By **2010**—just five years after launch—Yogos had largely vanished from shelves. The reasons were complex: portfolio consolidation as Kellogg's streamlined their kids' snack lineup, the rise of the \"clean label\" movement pushing parents toward snacks with transparent ingredients, and the snack industry's brutal churn where even beloved products get cycled out.\n\nToday, **Yogos remain a cultural artifact** of early 2000s innovation. Fans still petition on Change.org for a comeback, their product lives on in nostalgia compilations and Reddit threads, and the brand has become synonymous with \"that snack from my childhood.\" Yogos prove that some products transcend their actual market lifespan to become something larger: a touchstone of an era, a fond memory, and a reminder that even cult-favorite products can disappear almost without warning.",
