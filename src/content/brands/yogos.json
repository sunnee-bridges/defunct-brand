  "overview_md": "**Yogos** were Kellogg’s mid-2000s attempt to mash up fruit snacks with a sweet-tart yogurt-style shell. Sold in single-serve pouches, the candies were positioned as a fun, slightly tangy alternative to standard gummy fruit snacks and were heavily advertised on kids’ TV.\n\nThe line briefly expanded into **Yogos Bits** (smaller spheres in a multi-piece format) and rotated flavors/pack designs typical of the category. Despite strong awareness, Yogos had a relatively short lifecycle: by **~2010**, the brand had largely disappeared from major U.S. retailers. Fans still surface on social media asking for a comeback, but there’s been no official relaunch.\n\nYogos fit a common 2000s snack arc: fast trial from catchy ads and novelty texture, then fade as portfolios were streamlined and parents shifted toward snacks with simpler labels or perceived nutrition benefits.",
