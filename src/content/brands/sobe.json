  "summary": "Launched in the mid-1990s, SoBe rode herbal/functional trends with teas, juice blends, ‘Elixir’ bottles, and Y2K-era iconography (the lizard). PepsiCo bought the company in 2000; over time the lineup was pared back in the U.S. While numerous flavors quietly disappeared, SoBe hasn’t been formally retired—select products still appear via PepsiCo’s locator and regional distribution.",

  "overview_md": "**SoBe** (short for South Beach Beverage Company) helped define late-1990s cooler culture with herbal teas, juice blends, and flashy ‘Elixir’ bottles capped by a lizard logo. Founded in **1995**, the brand leaned into ginseng, guarana, and New Age flavor names just as functional beverages were breaking into the mainstream.\n\n**Identity & design.** SoBe’s instantly recognizable **dueling lizards**—two mirrored, gecko-like figures in a yin-yang posture—served as a bold shelf signal on bottles, caps, and case trays. The high-contrast lizard mark, oversized type, and saturated label colors made SoBe pop in crowded coolers and on endcaps.\n\n**Guerrilla buzz.** Early growth leaned on **guerrilla marketing** more than big TV buys: college-rep sampling, street teams at action-sports and music events, sticker packs, and convenience-store cooler takeovers. The result was word-of-mouth heat and strong presence where teens and twenty-somethings shopped.\n\nPepsiCo **acquired SoBe in 2000**, bringing national muscle—but as the 2010s progressed, category shifts and portfolio pruning cut many SKUs. Lines like **Lifewater**, specialty teas, and niche flavors were gradually trimmed, and distribution waned.\n\nDespite frequent “Is SoBe discontinued?” chatter, PepsiCo still lists SoBe and offers a **product locator**, signaling the brand isn’t officially dead—just **limited**. For most U.S. shoppers, SoBe now lives in nostalgia (and the occasional regional sighting), emblematic of the 90s/00s wave of functional drinks that later consolidated under bigger, simpler lineups.",
