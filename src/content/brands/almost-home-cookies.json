  "summary": "Nabisco’s **Almost Home** was positioned as soft, bakery-style cookies—chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, peanut butter and seasonal varieties—aimed at delivering a ‘fresh from the oven’ vibe without baking. The line built a steady following in the **1980s–1990s**, then faded as the company trimmed slower-moving SKUs and focused on bigger umbrellas like **Chips Ahoy!** and **SnackWell’s**. Today it survives mostly in nostalgia posts, vintage ads, and collectors’ packaging photos.",

  "overview_md": "Nabisco’s **Almost Home** line brought the ‘soft batch’ trend to supermarket aisles in the **1980s**, framing itself as a *homemade-style* cookie you didn’t have to bake. Packages commonly featured chocolate chip, **oatmeal raisin**, **peanut butter**, and other comfort flavors with a softer, chewier texture than classic crisp cookies.\n\nAs the **1990s** progressed, Nabisco pursued portfolio shake-ups (diet-leaning **SnackWell’s**, new **Chips Ahoy!** variants, and broader line rationalization). **Almost Home** gradually disappeared from major chains and then from planograms entirely. While there was no splashy recall or single shutdown date, retail presence dwindled and the line was ultimately **discontinued**.\n\nThe brand lives on in **vintage circulars and TV spots** that surface online, plus packaging photos shared by collectors. For many Gen X shoppers, Almost Home evokes after-school snacks, lunchbox trades, and that specific ‘soft cookie in a box’ texture that’s hard to find today.",
