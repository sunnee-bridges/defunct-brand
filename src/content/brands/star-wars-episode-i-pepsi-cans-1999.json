  "overview_md": "**Star Wars Episode I Pepsi Collection** was Pepsi’s blockbuster 1999 promotional campaign for _The Phantom Menace_. In the U.S., collectors chased **24 different character cans** (Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew, et al.), each printed with a small **“secret word.”** When assembled, those words formed **three hidden phrases**, turning a soda tie-in into a full-blown puzzle hunt. The campaign also seeded **rare gold Yoda cans** tied to instant-win cash prizes and created region-specific packaging in markets like Germany and Japan, spawning parallel collecting scenes.\n\nFor fans, the set became a **summer-long quest**: trading doubles, scanning grocery endcaps, and negotiating with convenience stores for fresh shipments. It hit at the peak of prequel hype, with TV spots, in-store displays, and theater promotions driving frenzy. Because the run was strictly **time-boxed to 1999**, complete sets stayed scarce, while mint cartons and display flats became the crown jewels. Today, the collection sits at the intersection of **’90s soda ephemera** and **Star Wars memorabilia**—still active on eBay, in Facebook groups, and in convention bins. Search demand endures around “1999 Pepsi Star Wars cans,” “Episode I collectibles,” and “gold Yoda can,” keeping this promotion firmly in nostalgia’s hall of fame.",
