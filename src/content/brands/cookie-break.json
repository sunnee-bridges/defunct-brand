  "summary": "Cookie Break was a Nabisco vanilla cookie line sold in U.S. grocery stores from the 1970s onward, remembered by shoppers as a simple everyday cookie that the company no longer makes. The COOKIE BREAK mark was first used in commerce in 1970, registered in 1975, and later allowed to expire as Nabisco discontinued the product. When consumers later asked about it, Nabisco’s explanation was that there were not enough buyers to support continued production, so the line was quietly retired and now mainly lives on in nostalgia threads and trademark records.",

  "overview_md": "**Cookie Break** was a Nabisco cookie line sold in the United States and remembered by shoppers as a straightforward vanilla cookie that the company no longer makes. In consumer Q&A, it is often cited when people ask what Nabisco vanilla cookies were called before they disappeared from shelves.\n\nAccording to the U.S. trademark record, *COOKIE BREAK* was first used in commerce in 1970, filed as a mark in September 1974, and registered in 1975 in the \"Staple Food Products\" category. The mark was later allowed to expire and is listed as dead/expired by the mid-2000s.\n\nPeople who actually bought the product recall it simply as **Nabisco Cookie Break vanilla cookies**, not as a heavily engineered or gimmick format. Descriptions that portray Cookie Break as a generic \"rectangular, glossy cookie designed to be broken apart\" appear to be AI-generated filler and do not match first-hand memories.\n\nWhen customers later contacted Nabisco about why Cookie Break was discontinued, the company’s explanation was that there were *\"not enough consumers buying the products to support its continued production.\"* In other words, the line was dropped for demand and portfolio reasons rather than a safety issue or public scandal.\n\nFor many shoppers, Cookie Break now shows up mainly in nostalgia threads and trademark lookups: a discontinued, everyday Nabisco vanilla cookie that quietly left the aisle once it no longer drew enough repeat buyers.",
