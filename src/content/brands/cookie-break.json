  "overview_md": "**Cookie Break** was a Nabisco-branded packaged cookie line remembered by many U.S. shoppers from the 1990s. Positioned as an everyday sweet snack, it appeared in typical grocery and mass retail channels alongside Chips Ahoy! and other category leaders. While flavors and formats varied by region and year, the line leaned into familiar chocolate and sandwich-cookie profiles with low-friction, lunchbox-friendly packaging.\n\nThe brand never became a headliner for Nabisco, which prioritized its franchise labels with larger ad budgets and permanent shelf programs. As snack aisles consolidated around top sellers, second-tier SKUs like Cookie Break lost space and faded from resets. By the early 2000s, the line had largely disappeared in favor of stronger national brands and private label alternatives.\n\nNostalgia threads keep the name alive, with former fans recalling school snacks, vending-machine sightings, and supermarket endcaps. Surviving packaging and coupons occasionally surface in ephemera groups, but there has been no formal revival. Cookie Break is a snapshot of 1990s grocery culture: broad experimentation, frequent limited-time runs, and a long tail of smaller lines that quietly exited as retail tightened assortments.",
