The name **Marathon** later causes confusion with the U.K., where **Snickers** was called Marathon until 1990 (the U.K. briefly revived the *Marathon* branding for nostalgia in 2019–2020).",

  "overview_md": "The U.S. **Marathon bar** was Mars’s extra-long, **braided caramel** candy bar coated in milk chocolate, launched in **1973**. Its signature gimmick was the **8-inch ruler** printed on the wrapper to emphasize length and chew time, supported by the tagline **“lasts a good long time.”** Despite memorable marketing and a small cult following, the product was **discontinued by 1981** as Mars trimmed slower sellers.\n\nA common point of confusion: in the **U.K.**, the name **Marathon** referred to what Americans know as **Snickers** until **1990**. That U.K. naming was temporarily revived for nostalgia promotions in **2019–2020**—but that has nothing to do with the U.S. braided caramel **Marathon** bar, which remains discontinued.",
