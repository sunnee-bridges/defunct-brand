  "summary": "Pearson’s **Seven Up** was a segmented milk-chocolate bar introduced in the 1930s. The bar was molded into seven small chambers, each holding a different filling. Lineups varied over time, but fan-favorite centers often included coconut, butterscotch caramel, buttercream, fudge, Brazil nut, cherry cream, and orange jelly. Production ended in 1979, though the bar still inspires intense nostalgia among candy collectors.",

  "overview_md": "The **Seven Up** candy bar came from Pearson’s Candy Company during the **1930s** and stood out for a clever format: **seven bite-size sections** under one milk-chocolate shell, each with a different filling. The exact mix changed across decades and regions, but longtime fans remember combinations like **coconut**, **butterscotch caramel**, **buttercream**, **fudge**, **Brazil nut**, **cherry cream**, and **orange jelly**.\n\nThat ‘sampler in a single bar’ idea gave Seven Up a small cult following—shoppers who liked variety and the surprise of not knowing which flavor you’d hit next. By the late 1970s, shifting costs, changing tastes, and a crowded confectionery aisle caught up with it. Pearson’s **ended production in 1979**, and the bar never returned to national shelves. Today it lives on in **candy-history blogs, wrapper archives, and collector forums**, where it’s often cited as one of the most-missed novelty bars of the mid-20th century.",
