  "overview_md": "**Hard Candy** was a cult makeup brand founded in 1995 that captured the edgy, alternative aesthetic of late-90s youth culture before being sold to Walmart in 2009 and transformed beyond recognition. The original Hard Candy—with its distinctive packaging, innovative products, and cool-girl cachet—bears almost no resemblance to the budget line that bears its name today.\n\nThe brand's origin story is pure 90s entrepreneurial mythology. **Dineh Mohajer**, a 22-year-old pre-med student at USC, mixed her own nail polish in her bathtub to create a **sky blue shade** to match a pair of sandals. When she wore the polish to a trendy Los Angeles boutique, the owner insisted on carrying it. Within weeks, **sky blue nail polish** became the unexpected accessory of 1995, spotted on celebrities and in fashion magazines. Mohajer dropped out of medical school to run Hard Candy full-time.\n\nThe timing was perfect. **Grunge and alternative culture** were mainstream by the mid-90s, and young women wanted makeup that reflected that aesthetic—edgy, playful, and anti-establishment rather than traditionally glamorous. Hard Candy delivered with unconventional nail polish colors (pastels, metallic, dark vampy shades), chunky glitter, colored mascaras, and body shimmer. The packaging was distinctive: **pastel-colored bottles with silver rings** attached, giving products a jewelry-like quality.\n\nHard Candy positioned itself as **prestige alternative**—more expensive than drugstore (nail polishes sold for $12-18) but cooler than department store. The brand was carried at **Nordstrom** and trendy boutiques, not mass retailers. This exclusivity was part of the appeal: owning Hard Candy signaled you were in-the-know, fashion-forward, and willing to invest in quality indie brands.\n\nThe **celebrity factor** amplified the buzz. Alicia Silverstone wore Hard Candy in *Clueless*-era appearances. Drew Barrymore, Gwen Stefani, and other 90s it-girls were photographed wearing the brand. Fashion magazines featured Hard Candy in editorial spreads. The sky blue nail polish, in particular, became an icon of 90s style—as recognizable as butterfly clips and platform sneakers.\n\nHard Candy competed directly with **Urban Decay**, another alternative makeup brand launched around the same time (1996). Both catered to young women who rejected traditional beauty standards and wanted products that felt subversive. The rivalry pushed both brands to innovate with unusual colors, provocative product names, and edgy marketing.\n\nBy the late 90s, Hard Candy had expanded beyond nail polish into a full cosmetics line: lipsticks, eyeshadows, body glitter, and the infamous **\"Hard Candy Lollipop\"** ring-shaped lip glosses. The brand opened its own boutiques and continued to command prestige pricing. For alternative and grunge-adjacent Gen X women, Hard Candy was a statement—makeup as rebellion, beauty as self-expression rather than conformity.\n\nHowever, the 2000s brought challenges. The brand changed ownership multiple times, creating instability. The alternative aesthetic that made Hard Candy cool in 1995 was becoming mainstream and losing its edge. Competitors like MAC and Sephora's house brand offered similar products with better distribution. By the mid-2000s, Hard Candy was struggling financially despite its cult following.\n\nIn **2009**, the brand was sold to **Walmart** in a deal that shocked loyal customers. Walmart repositioned Hard Candy as a **budget mass-market line** sold exclusively at Walmart stores for **$3-8** per product. The packaging was redesigned, the formulations were changed, the prestige positioning was abandoned, and the price dropped by 60-70%. The only thing that remained was the name.\n\nThe transformation was total and immediate. The **original Hard Candy**—the prestige indie brand with cult cachet—ceased to exist. The Walmart version had no connection to the original beyond trademark ownership. For fans of the original brand, it felt like a betrayal: a cool alternative brand had been bought, gutted, and turned into generic mass-market products bearing its name like a corpse puppet.\n\nThe backlash was immediate and fierce. Beauty bloggers and former fans expressed outrage and disappointment. Online forums filled with laments: \"This isn't the real Hard Candy.\" \"They ruined it.\" \"It's just cheap Walmart makeup now.\" Some consumers stockpiled original Hard Candy products from clearance sales, knowing the brand they loved was gone forever. Others simply moved on to other indie brands that hadn't \"sold out.\"\n\nToday, Hard Candy technically still exists as a Walmart brand. You can buy Hard Candy products in any Walmart. But to anyone who knew the original, it's a completely different entity—a zombie brand, wearing the name of something that died. The sky blue nail polish is gone, the distinctive packaging is gone, the prestige positioning is gone, and the cultural cool factor is gone. What remains is a budget makeup line that happens to use a name that once meant something.\n\nFor Gen X and older Millennial women who were teenagers in the late 90s, **original Hard Candy** represents a moment—the brief window when alternative culture felt genuinely alternative, when indie brands could succeed without corporate backing, and when a 22-year-old could mix nail polish in her bathtub and become a cultural phenomenon. That brand, that moment, that feeling—Walmart can't manufacture it, no matter how many products they label with the Hard Candy name.",
