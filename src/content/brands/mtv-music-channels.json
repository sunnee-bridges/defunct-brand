   "summary": "MTV’s identity began with the promise of a 24-hour music-video channel, launching on August 1, 1981 with The Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star” as its first music video—an instant symbol for the music-video era. As MTV grew, it expanded beyond rotation into unique programming and cultural reporting, with MTV News and Kurt Loder’s anchoring helping position music as current events and giving the network real-time authority during major pop and rock moments. \nOver time, the core utility of a linear music-video feed eroded as internet video and platforms like YouTube normalized on-demand discovery and endless rewatching, forcing MTV’s flagship schedule further toward non-video formats. In its final chapter, the MTV Music-only channel format made a full-circle sign-off in late 2025 — returning to “Video Killed the Radio Star” as a deliberate bookend to the era it helped define.",

  "overview_md": "**MTV Music** represents the music-video-only through-line of MTV’s original promise: a channel where videos weren’t a side dish—they were the whole show. MTV launched on **August 1, 1981**, and its **first music video** was **The Buggles’ “Video Killed the Radio Star”**—a perfect mission statement for a new medium built around sight, style, and instant replay. As the network matured, **MTV News** became a key layer of credibility and cultural impact, and **Kurt Loder’s on-air presence** helped turn music into a headline-driven timeline—breaking stories, contextualizing scenes, and making artists feel central to the broader conversation. But the reason a 24/7 music-video feed once mattered—turn it on and discover what’s next—slowly evaporated as internet video and **YouTube-style on-demand viewing** made discovery, replay, and sharing frictionless without a cable schedule. By the end of 2025, the music-video-only channel concept reached its final act, popularly remembered for closing the loop by returning to **“Video Killed the Radio Star”** as a symbolic last video—an ending that mirrors how online video ultimately replaced the channel’s original job.",
