 "summary": "**Orko** is the franchise’s primary magician—an earnest, floating **Trollan** from another dimension—introduced in Filmation’s 1983 cartoon and quickly merchandised by Mattel. The vintage 1980s action figure used a rip-cord mechanism that made him **spin in circles** to mimic floating. Comic relief on TV and a fan-favorite in the toy aisle, Orko has reappeared in later reboots (2002, 2021+) and modern collector lines.",

  "overview_md": "**Orko** debuted in the 1983 *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe* cartoon as a well-meaning but accident-prone **magician from Trolla**. On screen he added humor and heart, often botching spells but offering moral support and the show’s trademark PSA moments. Mattel turned Orko into a distinctive figure with a **rip-cord spinning base** instead of standard legs, leaning into his floating design. \n\nAcross reboots, Orko’s look and tone evolved—from Filmation’s slapstick sidekick to more capable (and sometimes heroic) versions in the 2002 series and modern Netflix iterations. Collectors continue to get updated sculpts in **Classics**, **Origins**, and **Masterverse** lines, cementing Orko as a core Masters character alongside He-Man, Skeletor, Teela, and Man-At-Arms.",
