  "overview_md": "**Ritz Camera** was a U.S. specialty retailer focused on cameras, lenses, film, and photo finishing. Founded in 1918, the chain expanded from a single coastal shop into hundreds of mall and street locations, often anchored by mini-labs that promised one-hour prints from 35mm film. Stores mixed enthusiast gear with approachable point-and-shoots, tripods, memory cards, and frames, while photo departments offered developing, enlargements, and passport photos—turning Ritz into an errand as much as a hobby stop.\n\nDuring the late 20th century, Ritz aggressively grew through new openings and acquisitions, pairing national advertising with circulars and photo-club promotions. But the **digital photography transition** upended its model: film processing volumes collapsed, margins on hardware compressed, and online sellers undercut store prices. The 2008–2009 recession compounded pressure with weaker discretionary spend and elevated lease costs.\n\nRitz **filed for Chapter 11 in 2009**, shuttering many locations and restructuring. A smaller chain continued, but persistent headwinds remained as smartphones absorbed casual photography. In **2012**, the company filed again, leading to additional closures and a sale of brand assets; remaining operations shifted toward e-commerce under new ownership. Ritz Camera’s legacy is bound to the era of one-hour photo labs, camera counters in every mall, and the excitement of picking up a fresh envelope of prints.",
