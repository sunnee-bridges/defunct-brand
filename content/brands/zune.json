  "overview_md": "**Zune** was Microsoft’s end-to-end music platform—portable players, the Zune desktop app, Marketplace, and the **Zune Pass** subscription. It introduced Wi-Fi track sharing and a distinctive, typography-forward UI. Later, the **Zune HD** earned strong reviews, but the iPod/iTunes lead and the rapid move to smartphones limited adoption. Hardware and brand were sunset by **2012**, and services were folded into Xbox/Groove before being retired.",
