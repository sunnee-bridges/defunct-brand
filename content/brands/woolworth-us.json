The corporate shell became **Venator Group** and later **Foot Locker, Inc.**, which still operates today. **Fun fact:** founder Frank W. Woolworth’s namesake **Woolworth Building** (opened 1913) was famously said to be paid **in cash from nickels and dimes**—a nod to the chain’s low-price roots.",

  "overview_md": "**F.W. Woolworth** popularized the five-and-dime format—fixed low prices, broad everyday assortment, and lunch counters that became cultural touchstones (and civil-rights landmarks). As specialty big boxes and discount chains rose, Woolworth’s variety format waned. In **1997** the company closed its remaining U.S. Woolworth stores, rebranded as **Venator Group**, and ultimately **Foot Locker, Inc.**—today a global athletic retailer—while international Woolworth banners followed their own paths. _Fun note:_ the 1913 **Woolworth Building** in New York, long among the world’s tallest, was widely reported as paid **in cash** by Frank W. Woolworth.",
