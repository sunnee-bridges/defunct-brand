  "overview_md": "**Jet.com** launched in **2015** with a bold idea: lower your price in real time as you optimized your cart—skip returns, choose slower shipping, or buy from nearby sellers and the **Smart Cart** would pass savings back instantly. The growth playbook leaned on marketplace breadth, rebates (**JetCash/Jet Anywhere** promos), and an urban-millennial merchandising lens.\n\nIn **2016**, **Walmart acquired Jet for $3.3B**, using Jet’s tech, talent (including founder **Marc Lore**), and seller network to jump-start Walmart.com. Over the next few years, Walmart steadily **integrated Jet’s pricing/fulfillment logic** and category teams into its core site. Jet experimented with city-specific experiences and incubations like **Jetblack** (a text-to-shop concierge pilot), but the strategy ultimately converged on a single Walmart.com brand.\n\nIn **May 2020**, Walmart **retired the Jet brand**, noting that Jet’s capabilities were fully embedded into Walmart’s broader e-commerce stack. For shoppers, Jet.com disappeared; for Walmart, Jet’s legacy lives on in **marketplace scale, price optimization, and last-mile learnings**.",
